                <p>Chapter 15: Search
Search is a fundamental feature of most websites and certainly anything e-commerce
related like our Bookstore. In this chapter we will learn how to implement basic search
with forms and filters. Then we will improve it with additional logic and touch upon
ways to go even more deeply with search options in Django.
We only have three books in our database now but the code here will scale to as many
books as we’d like.
Search functionality consists of two parts: a form to pass along a user search query
and then a results page that performs a filter based on that query. Determining “the
right” type of filter is where search becomes interesting and hard. But first we need
to create both a form and the search results page.
We could start with either one at this point, but’ll we configure the filtering first and
then the form.
Search Results Page
We’ll start with the search results page. As with all Django pages that means adding
a dedicated URL, view, and template. The implementation order doesn’t particularly
matter, but we will add them in that order.
Within books/urls.py add a search/ path that will take a view called SearchResultsListView
and has a URL name of search_results.
Chapter 15: Search
 292
Code</p>
<h1 id="booksurlspy">books/urls.py</h1>
<p>from django.urls import path
from .views import BookListView, BookDetailView, SearchResultsListView # new
urlpatterns = [
path('', BookListView.as_view(), name='book_list'),
path('<uuid:pk>', BookDetailView.as_view(), name='book_detail'),
path('search/', SearchResultsListView.as_view(), name='search_results'), # new
]
Next up is the view SearchResultsListView which is, for now, a listing of all available
books. That’s a prime candidate for using ListView. Its template will be called search_-
results.html and live within the templates/books/ directory. The only new code is for
SearchResultsListView as we have previously imported both ListView and the Book
model at the top of the file.
Code</p>
<h1 id="booksviewspy">books/views.py</h1>
<p>...
class SearchResultsListView(ListView): # new
model = Book
context_object_name = 'book_list'
template_name = 'books/search_results.html'
Last up is our template which must be created.
Chapter 15: Search
 293
Command Line
$ touch templates/books/search_results.html
For now it will list all available book’s by title, author, and price.
Code
<!-- templates/books/search_results.html -->
{% extends '_base.html' %}
{% block title %}Search{% endblock title %}
{% block content %}
<h1>Search Results</h1>
{% for book in book_list %}
<div>
<h3><a href="{{ book.get_absolute_url }}">{{ book.title }}</a></h3>
<p>Author: {{ book.author }}</p>
<p>Price: $ {{ book.price }}</p>
</div>
{% endfor %}
{% endblock content %}
The search results page is now available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/books/search/246.

And there it is!
Search page
Basic Filtering
In Django a QuerySet247 is used to filter the results from a database model. Currently
our search results page doesn’t feel like one because it is outputting all results from
the Book model. Ultimately we want to run the filter based on the user’s search query,
but first we’ll work through multiple filtering options.
It turns out there are multiple ways to customize a queryset including via a manager248
on the model itself but to keep things simple, we can add a filter with just one line. So
let’s do that!
We can override the default queryset attribute on ListView which by default shows
247 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/db/queries/#retrieving-objects
248 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/db/managers/#django.db.models.Manager
Chapter 15: Search
 295
all results. The queryset documentation is quite robust and detailed, but often using
contains249 (which is case sensitive) or icontains250 (which is not case sensitive) are
good starting points. We will implement the filter based on the title that “contains”
the name “beginners”.
Code</p>
<h1 id="booksviewspy_1">books/views.py</h1>
<p>class SearchResultsListView(ListView):
model = Book
context_object_name = 'book_list'
template_name = 'books/search_results.html'
queryset = Book.objects.filter(title__icontains='beginners') # new
Refresh the search results page and now only a book with the title containing
“beginners” is displayed. Success!
Search page for “beginners”
For basic filtering most of the time the built-in queryset methods251 of filter(), all(),
get(), or exclude() will be enough. However there is also a very robust and detailed
249 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/models/querysets/#contains
250 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/models/querysets/#icontains
251 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/db/queries/#other-queryset-methods
Chapter 15: Search
QuerySet API252 available as well that is worthy of further study.
296
Q Objects
Using filter() is powerful and it’s even possible to chain filters253 together such as
search for all titles that contain “beginners” and “django”. However often you’ll want
more complex lookups that can use “OR” not just “AND”; that’s when it is time to turn
to Q objects254.
Here’s an example where we set the filter to look for a result that matches a title of
either “beginners” or “api”. It’s as simple as importing Q at the top of the file and then
subtly tweaking our existing query. The | symbol represents the “or” operator. We can
filter on any available field: not just title but also author or price as desired.
As the number of filters grows it can be helpful to separate out the queryset override
via get_queryset(). That’s what we’ll do here but note that this choice is optional.
Code</p>
<h1 id="booksviewspy_2">books/views.py</h1>
<p>from django.db.models import Q # new
...
class SearchResultsListView(ListView):
model = Book
context_object_name = 'book_list'
template_name = 'books/book_list.html'
def get_queryset(self): # new
252 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/models/querysets/#queryset-api
253 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/db/queries/#chaining-filters
254 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/db/queries/#complex-lookups-with-q-objects
Chapter 15: Search
return Book.objects.filter(
Q(title__icontains='beginners') | Q(title__icontains='api')
)
Refresh the search results page to see the new result.
297
Search with Q objects
Now let’s turn our attention to the corresponding search form so that rather than
hardcode our filters in we can populate them based on the user’s search query.
Forms
Fundamentally a web form is simple: it takes user input and sends it to a URL via either
a GET or POST method. However in practice this fundamental behavior of the web can
be monstrously complex.
The first issue is sending the form data: where does the data actually go and how
do we handle it once there? Not to mention there are numerous security concerns
whenever we allow users to submit data to a website.
Chapter 15: Search
 298
There are only two options for “how” a form is sent: either via GET or POST HTTP
methods.
A POST bundles up form data, encodes it for transmission, sends it to the server, and
then receives a response. Any request that changes the state of the database–creates,
edits, or deletes data–should use a POST.
A GET bundles form data into a string that is added to the destination URL. GET should
only be used for requests that do not affect the state of the application, such as a
search where nothing within the database is changing, basically we’re just doing a
filtered list view.
If you look at the URL after visiting Google.com you’ll see your search query in the
actual search results page URL itself.
For more information, Mozilla has detailed guides on both sending form data255 and
form data validation256 that are worth reviewing if you’re not already familiar with
form basics.
Search Form
Let’s add a basic search form to the current homepage right now. It can easily be
placed in the navbar or on a dedicated search page as desired in the future.
We start with HTML <form> tags and use Bootstrap’s styling to make them look nice.
The action specifies where to redirect the user after the form is submitted, which will
be the search_results page. As with all URL links this is the URL name for the page.
Then we indicate the desired method of get rather than post.
The second part of the form is the input which contains the user search query. We
provide it with a variable name, q, which will be later visible in the URL and also available
255 https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Sending_and_retrieving_form_data
256 https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Form_validation
Chapter 15: Search
 299
in the views file. We add Bootstrap styling with the class, specify the type of input is
text, add a Placeholder which is default text that prompts the user. The last part,
aria-label, is the name provided to screen reader users. Accessibility is a big part
of web development and should always be considered from the beginning: include
aria-labels with all your forms!
Code
<!-- templates/home.html -->
{% extends '_base.html' %}
{% load static %}
{% block title %}Home{% endblock title %}
{% block content %}
<h1>Homepage</h1>
<form class="form-inline mt-2 mt-md-0" action="{% url 'search_results' %}"
method="get">
<input name="q" class="form-control mr-sm-2" type="text" placeholder="Search"
aria-label="Search">
</form>
{% endblock content %}
Navigate to the homepage and the new search box is present.
Chapter 15: Search
 300
Homepage with search box
Try inputting a search, for example for “hello.” Upon hitting Return you are redirected
to the search results page. Note in particular the URL contains the search query
http://127.0.0.1:8000/books/search/?q=hello257 .
URL with query string
However the results haven’t changed! And that’s because our SearchResultsListView
still has the hardcoded values from before. The last step is to take the user’s search
query, represented by q in the URL, and pass it in to the actual search filters.
257 http://127.0.0.1:8000/books/search/?q=hello
Chapter 15: Search
Code</p>
<h1 id="booksviewspy_3">books/views.py</h1>
<p>class SearchResultsListView(ListView):
model = Book
context_object_name = 'book_list'
template_name = 'books/search_results.html'
301
def get_queryset(self): # new
query = self.request.GET.get('q')
return Book.objects.filter(
Q(title__icontains=query) | Q(author__icontains=query)
)
What changed? We added a query variable that takes the value of q from the form
submission. Then updated our filter to use query on either a title or an author field.
That’s it! Refresh the search results page–it still has the same URL with our query–and
the result is expected: no results on either title or author for “hello”.
Go back to the homepage and try a new search such as for “django” or “beginners” or
“william” to see the complete search functionality in action.
Git
Make sure to save our current work in this chapter by committing the new code to
Git.

Command Line
$ git status
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'ch15'

Conclusion
Our basic search is now complete, but we’ve only scratched the surface of potential
search optimizations. For example, maybe we want a button added to the search form
that could be clicked in addition to hitting the Return key? Or better yet include form
validation. Beyond filtering with ANDs and ORs there are other factors if we want a
Google-quality search, things like relevancy and much more.
A next-step would be to use a third-party package like django-watson259 or django-
haystack260 to add more advanced search.
Or given that we’re using PostgreSQL as the database take advantage of its full text
search261 .
A final option is either use an enterprise-level solution like ElasticSearch262 that must
be running on a separate server (not the hardest thing with Docker), or rely on a
hosted solution like Swiftype263 or Algolia264 .
In the next chapter we’ll explore the many performance optimizations available in
Django as we prepare our Bookstore project for eventual deployment.
