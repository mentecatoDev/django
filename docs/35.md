Chapter 17: Security
The World Wide Web is a dangerous place. There are many bad actors and even
more automated bots that will try to hack into your website and cause ill. Therefore
understanding and implementing security features is a must in any website.
Fortunately Django has a very strong record when it comes to security thanks to
its years of experience handling web security issues as well as a robust and regular
security update cycle. New feature releases295 come out roughly every 9 months such
as 2.2 to 3.0 but there are also patch releases around bugs and security like 2.2.2 to
2.2.3 that occur almost monthly.
However as with any tool it’s important to implement security features correctly and
in this chapter we’ll cover how to do so in our bookstore project.
Social Engineering
The biggest security risk to any website is ultimately not technical: it is people. The
term social engineering296 refers to the technique of finding individuals with access
to a system who will willingly or unwillingly share their their login credentials with a
bad actor.
These days phishing297 is probably the most likely culprit if you are in a technical
organization. All it takes is one bad click on an email link for a malicious actor to
potentially gain access to the system, or at least all the access the compromised
employee has.

297 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing
Chapter 17: Security
 319
To mitigate this risk, implement a robust permissions scheme and only provide the
exact security access an employee needs, not more. Does every engineer need access
to the production database? Probably not. Do non-engineers need write access?
Again, probably not.These are discussions best had up front and a good default is to
only add permissions as needed, not to default to superuser status for everyone!
Django updates
Keeping your project up-to-date with the latest version of Django is another impor-
tant way to stay secure. And I don’t just mean being current with the latest feature
release298 (2.2, 3.0, 3.1, etc) which comes out roughly every 9 months. There are also
monthly security patch updates that take the form of 2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.2.3, etc.
What about long-term support (LTS) releases? Certain feature releases designated
as LTS receive security and data loss fixes for a guaranteed period of time, usually
around 3 years. For example, Django 2.2 is an LTS and will be supported into 2022
when Django 4.0 is released as the next LTS version. Can you stay on LTS versions?
Yes. Should you? No. It is better and more secure to stay up-to-date.
Resist the temptation and reality of many real-world projects which is not to devote
a portion of developer time to staying current with Django versions. A website is like
a car: it needs regular maintenance to run at its best. You are only compounding the
problem if you put off updates.
How to update? Django features deprecation warnings299 that can and should be run
for each new release by typing python -Wa manage.py test. It is far better to update
from 2.0 to 2.1 to 2.2 and run the deprecation warnings each time rather than skipping
multiple versions.

Deployment Checklist
To assist with with deployment and checking security settings, the Django docs
contain a dedicated deployment checklist300 that further describes security settings.
Even better there is a command we can run to automate Django’s recommendations,
python manage.py check --deploy, that will check if a project is deployment ready. It
uses the Django system check framework301 which can be used to customize similar
commands in mature projects.
Since we are working in Docker we must prepend docker-compose exec web to the
command though.
Command Line
$ docker-compose exec web python manage.py check --deploy
System check identified some issues:
WARNINGS:
...
System check identified 9 issues (0 silenced).
How nice! A descriptive and lengthy list of issues which we can go through one-by-
one to prepare our Bookstore project.
Local vs. Production
Ultimately our local development settings will differ from those used in production.
There are a number of techniques to manage this complexity including the use of

 321
multiple settings.py files, however, a cleaner approach is to take advantage of our
existing use of Docker and environment variables.
Let’s start by adding an ENVIRONMENT setting into bookstore_project/settings.py near
the top of the file, right below BASE_DIR. Set the default to production since it’s always
good to default to production settings, otherwise you risk deploying a project that
has security vulnerabilities.
Code
# bookstore_project/settings.py
ENVIRONMENT = os.environ.get('ENVIRONMENT', default='development')
Within the existing docker-compose.yml file add an ENVIRONMENT variable for development.
docker-compose.yml
version: '3.7'
services:
web:
build: .
command: python /code/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
environment:
- ENVIRONMENT=development
...
Now here’s where the magic happens. We’ll create a dedicated docker-compose-prod.yml
file just for production settings.
Chapter 17: Security
 322
Command Line
$ touch docker-compose-prod.yml
Copy and paste the existing docker-compose.yml file into the docker-compose-prod.yml
file and remove any volumes. The volumes serve to persist information locally within
the Docker containers but are not needed in production.
Then change ENVIRONMENT from development to production.
docker-compose-prod.yml
version: '3.7'
services:
web:
build: .
command: python /code/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
environment:
- ENVIRONMENT=production
- SECRET_KEY=p_o3vp1rg5)t^lxm9-43%0)s-=1qpeq%o7gfq+e4#*!t+_ev82
- DEBUG=1
- STRIPE_TEST_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<pk_test_your_publishable_key_here>
- STRIPE_TEST_SECRET_KEY=<sk_test_your_secret_key_here>
ports:
- 8000:8000
depends_on:
- db
db:
image: postgres:11
Chapter 17: Security
 323
Make sure SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_TEST_PUBLISHABLE_KEY, and STRIPE_TEST_SECRET_KEY con-
tain your own specific values, not the placeholders included here!
DEBUG
First up is the DEBUG302 setting, currently set to “True” with the number “1” in the
Compose file. Debug should never be on when deploying a site to production.
One of debug modes main features is detailed error pages that display a host of
metadata about the environment including most currently defined settings. This is
helpful for spotting errors but a recipe for potential hackers to compromise a website.
Debug mode also remembers every SQL query executed which helps with debugging,
but dramatically consumes memory on a production server.
Therefore we must switch DEBUG to “0”, or “False”, in docker-compose-prod.yml.
docker-compose-prod.yml
DEBUG=0
ALLOWED HOSTS
Next up is the ALLOWED_HOSTS303 configuration which controls the host/domain
names our Django site can serve. It likely exists right below DEBUG in the bookstore_-
project/settings.py file. By default in development it is set to [], an empty list. But
for production, when DEBUG is False, it must be set explicitly and include values.
The two ways we access it locally which are via either 127.0.0.1 or localhost. We will
be using Heroku for deployments in the next section and all of its hosted sites are at
the subdomain of '.herokuapp.com', so we can add that now.
302 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/settings/#std:setting-DEBUG
303 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/settings/#allowed-hosts
Chapter 17: Security
Code
# bookstore_project/settings.py
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['.herokuapp.com', 'localhost', '127.0.0.1']
324
To confirm, spin down the Docker host now and restart it via the -f flag to specify an
alternate compose file304. By default Docker assumes a docker-compose.yml so adding
the -f flag is unnecessary in that case.
Command Line
$ docker-compose down
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-prod.yml up -d --build
$ docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
The --build flag is added for the initial building of the image, along with all the
corresponding software packages, for the new compose file. Also migrate is run on
the new database. This is an entirely new instance of our project! As such it won’t
have a superuser account or any of our data such as book information. But that’s OK
for now; that information can be added in production and for now our focus to is pass
the deployment checklist!
Run the --deploy check again.
Command Line
$ docker-compose exec web python manage.py check --deploy
...
System check identified 7 issues (0 silenced).
There is still a long string of warnings but only 7 issues now, not 9 because DEBUG and
ALLOWED_HOSTS have been fixed. Success! Two down and many more to go.

Web Security
Now it is time for a brief dive into web security. Django handles most common use
cases, however, it is still vital to understand frequent attack methods and the steps
Django takes to mitigate them. You can find an overview on the Django security
page305, but we’ll go into further depth here.
Django comes by default with a number of additional security middlewares306 that
guard against other request/response cycle attacks.
A full explanation of each is beyond the scope of this book, but it is worth reading
about the protections provided by the Django security team over the years. Do not
change the defaults without good cause.
SQL injection
Let’s start with a SQL injection attack307 which occurs when a malicious user can
execute arbitrary SQL code on a database. Consider a log in form on a site. What
happens if a malicious user instead types DELETE from users WHERE user_id=user_-
id? If this is run against the database without proper protections it could result in
the deletion of all user records! Not good. This XKCD comic308 provides a humorous
though potentially accurate example of how this can occur.
Fortunately the Django ORM automatically sanitizes user inputs by default when
constructing querysets to prevent this type of attack. Where you need to be careful is
that Django does provide the option to execute custom sql309 or raw queries310. These

Chapter 17: Security
 326
should both be used with extreme caution since they could open up a vulnerability to
SQL injection.
The non-profit Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) has a fantastic and
very detailed SQL Injection Cheat Sheet311 that is recommended for further reading.
XSS (Cross Site Scripting)
Cross-site scripting (XSS)312 is another classic attack that occurs when an attacker is
able to inject small bits of code onto web pages viewed by other people. This code,
typically JavaScript, if stored in the database will then be retrieved and displayed to
other users.
For example, consider the form used for writing book reviews on our current site.
What if instead of typing, “This book was great” a user typed something with JavaScript?
For example, <script>alert('hello');</script>. If this script were stored on the
database then every future user’s page would have a pop-up saying “hello”. While
this particular example is more annoying than dangerous, a site vulnerable to XSS
is very dangerous because a malicious user could insert any JavaScript into the page,
including JavaScript that steals pretty much anything from an unsuspecting user.
To prevent an XSS attack Django templates automatically escape313 specific charac-
ters that are potentially dangerous including brackets (< and >), single quotes ', double
quotes ", and the ampersand &. There are some edge cases where you might want to
turn autoescape off314 but this should be used with extreme caution.
One step we do want to take is to set SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER315 to True
311 https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_
Sheet.md

Chapter 17: Security
 327
which will use the X-XSS-Protection Header316 to help guard against XSS attacks.
We can use the ENVIRONMENT setting now to add if/else logic at the bottom of our
bookstore_project/settings.py file. If we are in production, then make sure that
SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER is set to True.
Code
# bookstore_project/settings.py
# production
if ENVIRONMENT == 'production':
SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER = True # new
Spin down the container and start it up again to register the changes to our settings
file. Running the --deploy check again shows we’re now down to 6 issues!
Command Line
$ docker-compose down
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-prod.yml up -d
$ docker-compose exec web python manage.py check --deploy
Even with Django’s protections in place always be careful when storing HTML in
a database that will then be displayed to users. OWASP’s XSS Cheat Sheet317 is
recommended for further reading.
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)318 is the third major type of attack but generally
lesser known than SQL Injection or XSS. Fundamentally it exploits that trust a site has

in a user’s web browser.
When a user logs in to a website, let’s call it a banking website for illustration purposes,
the server sends back a session token for that user. This is included in the HTTP
Headers of all future requests and authenticates the user. But what happens if a
malicious actor somehow obtains access to this session token?
For example, consider a user who logs into their bank in one browser tab. Then in
another tab they open their email and click on an email link from a malicious actor.
This link looks legitimate, but in fact it is pointing to the user’s bank which they are
still logged into! So instead of leaving a blog comment on this fake site, behind the
scenes the user’s credentials are used to transfer money from their account to the
hacker’s account.
In practice there are multiple ways to obtain a user’s credentials via a CSRF attack,
not just links, but hidden forms, special image tags, and even AJAX requests.
Django provides CSRF protection319 by including a random secret key both as a
cookie via CSRF Middleware320 and in a form via the csrf_token321 template tag. A 3rd
party website will not have access to a user’s cookies and therefore any discrepancy
between the two keys causes an error.
As ever, Django does allow customization: you can disable the CSRF middleware and
use the csrf_protect()322 template tag on specific views. However, undertake this step
with extreme caution.
The OWASP CSRF Cheat Sheet323 provides a comprehensive look at the issue. Almost
all major websites have been victims of CSRF attacks at some point in time.
A good rule of thumb is whenever you have a form on your site, think about whether

Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.md
Chapter 17: Security
you need to include the csrf_token tag in it. Most of the time you will!
329
Clickjacking Protection
Clickjacking324 is yet another attack when a malicious site tricks a user into clicking
on a hidden frame. An internal frame, known as an iframe, is commonly used to embed
one website within another. For example, if you wanted to include a Google Map or
YouTube video on your site you would include the iframe tag that puts that site within
your own. This is very convenient.
But it has a security risk which is that a frame can be hidden from a user. Consider
if a user is already logged into their Amazon account and then visits a malicious site
that purports to be a picture of kittens. The user clicks on said malicious site to see
more kittens, but in fact they click an iFrame of an Amazon item that is unknowingly
purchased. This is but one example of clickjacking.
To prevent against this Django comes with a default clickjacking middleware325 that
checks whether or not a resource can be loaded within a frame or iframe. You can
turn this protection off if desired or even set it at a per view level. As ever, do so with
a degree of caution and research326 .
For production though we will set it to DENY rather than the default of SAMEORIGIN.
Note that strings must be placed around it so use 'DENY' rather than simply DENY.

Command Line

Now only 5 issues remaining!
330
HTTPS/SSL
All modern websites should use HTTPS327 which provides encrypted communication
between a client and server. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)328 is the backbone
of the modern web, but it does not, by default, have encryption.
The “s” in HTTPS refers to its encrypted nature first due to SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)
and these days its successor TLS (Transport Layer Security)329 .
With HTTPS enabled, which we will do in our deployment chapter, malicious actors
can’t sniff the incoming and outgoing traffic for data like authentication credentials
or API keys.
327 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS
328 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol
329 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security
Chapter 17: Security
 331
In our settings.py file we can force all non-HTTPS traffic to be redirected to HTTPS.
Add the following line at the bottom of the file.
Code
# bookstore_project/settings.py
# production
if ENVIRONMENT == 'production':
SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER = True
X_FRAME_OPTIONS = 'DENY'
SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True # new
HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)330 is a security policy that lets our server
enforce that web browsers should only interact via HTTPS by adding a Strict-
Transport-Security header331 .
It’s best to start with a small value of time for testing, such as 3600 seconds, one
hour, and then later extending it to one year (314,536,000 seconds). This is done in
the SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS332 config which is implicitly set to 0.
We don’t have any subdomains in our Bookstore project so it makes sense to force
any subdomains to also exclusively use SSL via the SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUB-
DOMAINS333 setting.
Also SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD334 to True.

Finally also SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF335 which controls nosniff336 set to
True
Code

SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER = True

SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS = True # new
SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD = True # new
SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF = True # new
Secure Cookies
An HTTP Cookie 337 is used to store information on a client’s computer such as
authentication credentials. This is necessary because the HTTP protocol is stateless
by design: there’s no way to tell if a user is authenticated other than including an
identifier in the HTTP Header!
Django uses sessions and cookies for this, as do most websites. But cookies can and
should be forced over HTTPS as well via the SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE338 config.
It defaults to False so we must set it to True in production. We can also do the same
for CSRF cookies using CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE339 .

Admin Hardening
So far it may seem as though the advice is to rely on Django defaults, use HTTPS,
add csrf_token tags on forms, and set a permissions structure. All true. But one step
Django does not take on our behalf is hardening the Django admin.
Chapter 17: Security
 334
Consider that every Django website sets the admin, by default, to the /admin URL.
This is a prime suspect for any hacker trying to access a Django site. Therefore an
easy step is to simply change the admin URL to literally anything else!
To do this, open up the bookstore_project/urls.py file. In this example it’s been set
to anything-but-admin/.
Code
# bookstore_project/urls.py
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include
urlpatterns = [
# Django admin
path('anything-but-admin/', admin.site.urls), # new
# User management
path('accounts/', include('allauth.urls')),
# Local apps
path('', include('pages.urls')),
path('books/', include('books.urls')),
]
if settings.DEBUG:
urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
Chapter 17: Security
 335
A fun 3rd party package django-admin-honeypot340 will generate a fake admin log in
screen and email site admins341 the IP address of anyone trying to attack your site at
/admin. These IP addresses can then be added to a blocked address list for the site.
It’s also possible via django-two-factor-auth342 to add two-factor authentication to
your admin for an even further layer of protection.
Git
This chapter has been particularly heavy on code changes so make sure to commit all
the updates with Git.
Command Line
$ git status
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'ch17'
If you have any errors, check your logs with docker-compose logs and compare you
code with the official source code on Github343.
Conclusion
Security is a major concern for any website, especially one that handles payments
like our Bookstore. By using a docker-compose-prod.yml file we can accurately test,
within Docker, our production settings before deploying the site live. Django comes
with many built-in security features and with the addition of the deployment checklist
we can now deploy our site now with a high degree of confidence that it is secure.

areas of concern, keeping your website up-to-date with the latest Django version is
vital for continued safety.
