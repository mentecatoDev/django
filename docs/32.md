Chapter 14: Orders with Stripe
Stripe230 is one of the most popular payment providers and what we’ll use in this book
to power book order purchases. It has two main offerings from Stripe: Checkout231
which allows for the use of pre-built forms from Stripe and Connect232 which is used
for a marketplace with multiple buyers and sellers. For example if we added book
authors as users and wanted to process payments on their behalf, taking a commission
for ourselves on the Bookstore website, then we would use Connect. But since we are
just processing payments we will use Checkout.
Checkout itself is undergoing rapid iteration. There are now two Checkout options233
available to developers: a “Client Integration” where the payment form is hosted on
Stripe itself and a “Server Integration” where we host the form ourselves. Since we’re
using Django we’ll opt for the Server Integration approach.
The second major change is a new API that relies on Sessions234, however, as of
the writing of this book, Sessions is not fully implemented and poorly documented.
Therefore we will use the traditional Stripe approach which will be supported well
into the future. Once you’ve understood how Stripe works under-the-hood making
the switch in the future will be much easier.
It’s easy to become lost in all the complexity around payments, however, the important
part for this book is understanding how payments are securely processed. That is
what we’ll do here. By the end of this chapter we’ll have a working payments solution
and the ability to further customize it as needed.

Payments Flow
Before we become lost in the implementation details, let’s plan out how the payments
flow should work. Currently there is a books page that lists all available books and then
individual pages for each book. In the last chapter we saw how to add a permission
for access to all books. Ultimately when an order is successfully completed, that user
needs to have this permission flag flipped in the database. That’s all we’re doing here!
When a user is on the books page we’ll include a link to a dedicated orders page which,
upon success, will redirect back to the books page with all books now available. We
can add in some template logic to replace “Order” buttons with “Read” buttons for
the appropriate user.
Keep this high-level flow in mind as we go through the implementation process!
Orders app
We’ll create a dedicated orders app and then configure it in the standard way: adding
to INSTALLED_APPS configuration, updating urls.py files, creating views, and then
templates.
Ready? Here we go. Start by creating a new orders app.
Command Line
$ docker-compose exec web python manage.py startapp orders
Then add it to the INSTALLED_APPS configuration in bookstore_project/settings.py.
Chapter 14: Orders with Stripe
Code
# bookstore_project/settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
'django.contrib.admin',
'django.contrib.auth',
'django.contrib.contenttypes',
'django.contrib.sessions',
'django.contrib.messages',
'django.contrib.staticfiles',
'django.contrib.sites',
# Third-party
'crispy_forms',
'allauth',
'allauth.account',
265
]
# Local
'users.apps.UsersConfig',
'pages.apps.PagesConfig',
'books.apps.BooksConfig',
'orders.apps.OrdersConfig', # new
Update the top-level bookstore_project/urls.py file with orders routes which will live
at orders/.
Chapter 14: Orders with Stripe
 266
Code
# bookstore_project/urls.py
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include
urlpatterns = [
# Django admin
path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
# User management
path('accounts/', include('allauth.urls')),
# Local apps
path('', include('pages.urls')),
path('books/', include('books.urls')),
path('orders/', include('orders.urls')), # new
] + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
And then create a orders/urls.py file to create app-level URL routes.
Command Line
$ touch orders/urls.py
Since the top-level urls.py file is at orders/ we can simply use the empty string '' for
the main orders page. Provide a name of the path of orders and reference the view
OrdersPageView which we’ll create next.
Chapter 14: Orders with Stripe
 267
Code
# orders/urls.py
from django.urls import path
from .views import OrdersPageView
urlpatterns = [
path('', OrdersPageView.as_view(), name='orders'),
]
The view file will simply use TemplateView for now.
Code
# orders/views.py
from django.views.generic.base import TemplateView
class OrdersPageView(TemplateView):
template_name = 'orders/purchase.html'
Finally we have the template which will live in a templates/orders/ directory.
Command Line
$ mkdir templates/orders
$ touch templates/orders/purchase.html
Let’s just use a placeholder heading of “Orders page” for now to test that it’s working
correctly.
Chapter 14: Orders with Stripe
 268
Code
<!-- templates/orders/purchase.html -->
{% extends '_base.html' %}
{% block title %}Orders{% endblock title %}
{% block content %}
<h1>Orders page</h1>
{% endblock content %}
The code is all done. But we must restart our containers so that the settings.py file
update–adding orders to INSTALLED_APPS–is loaded into Django.
Command Line
$ docker-compose down
$ docker-compose up -d
In your web browser visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/orders/235 to see our new orders
page.

Stripe
We turn our attention to Stripe which needs to be installed locally. The Python library
for Stripe is currently undergoing rapid iteration and is available on Github236 .
Command Line
$ docker-compose exec web pipenv install stripe==2.32.0
$ docker-compose down
$ docker-compose up -d --build
Then go to the Stripe website and register for a new account237 . Stripe regularly
updates its new user onboarding flow, but as of the writing of this book the next page
asks whether you want to use the Stripe API or an app. We want the API so select that
option which redirects to the dashboard238 page.
Adding an account name is optional but recommended in the upper left corner. I’ve
selected “DFP Book”. Now click on the “Developers” link in the left sidebar.

Developers Link
From dropdown list click on “API keys”.
270
Chapter 14: Orders with Stripe
 271
API Keys Link
Each Stripe account has four API keys: two for testing and two for live use in
production. Currently we are viewing the Test keys. We know this because there is a
“TEST DATA” indicator at the top of the page and the keys (also called tokens) contain
test in the name.
Chapter 14: Orders with Stripe
 272
Test Keys
Viewing live keys requires both confirming your account via email and filling out an
“Activate Your Account” page that is prompted if you click on the link at the top to
toggle the keys.
Chapter 14: Orders with Stripe
 273
Activate Your Account
Filling this page out is somewhat onerous, but we are dealing with money here so the
extra information is warranted. However doing so now is optional. We can use the
test keys and later swap in the live keys when we actually deploy the final site.
Publishable & Secret Keys
There are two types of keys for testing: a “publishable key” and a “secret key”. The
publishable key will be embedded in the JavaScript on our webpage; it is therefore
public and visible. The secret key is stored on the server and is for private use only.
Keep this key secret!
That means using environment variables which we’ll do now. At the bottom of your
bookstore_project/settings.py file, add the following two lines.
Chapter 14: Orders with Stripe
Code
# bookstore_project/settings.py
# Stripe
STRIPE_TEST_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=os.environ.get('STRIPE_TEST_PUBLISHABLE_KEY')
STRIPE_TEST_SECRET_KEY=os.environ.get('STRIPE_TEST_SECRET_KEY')
Add the environment variables to docker-compose.yml in the web section.
docker-compose.yml
version: '3.7'
274
services:
web:
build: .
command: python /code/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
environment:

db:

Chapter 14: Orders with Stripe
 275
- postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/
volumes:
postgres_data:
Note that both environment variables should be filled with your unique API keys.
Never share–especially in a book!–your actual Stripe secret key.
Then restart the Docker containers to load in the environment variables.
Command Line
$ docker-compose down
$ docker-compose up -d
Stripe Checkout
Step one is to add the Stripe Checkout form to our orders/purchase.html template.
Code
<!-- templates/orders/purchase.html -->
{% extends '_base.html' %}
{% block title %}Orders{% endblock title %}
{% block content %}
<h1>Orders page</h1>
<p>Buy for $39.00</p>
<script src="https://checkout.stripe.com/checkout.js" class="stripe-button"
data-key="{{ stripe_key }}"
Chapter 14: Orders with Stripe
data-description="All Books"
data-amount="3900"
data-locale="auto">
</script>
{% endblock content %}
276
If you refresh the web page at http://127.0.0.1:8000/orders/239 the default Stripe
Checkout blue button appears.
Orders Page
Click on the “Pay with Card” button and the Checkout modal appears. We can test the
form by using one of several test card numbers 240 Stripe provides. Let’s use 4242 4242
4242 4242. Make sure the expiration date is in the future and add any 3 numbers for
the CVC.
239 http://127.0.0.1:8000/orders/
240 https://stripe.com/docs/testing#cards
Chapter 14: Orders with Stripe
 277
Checkout Modal
But there’s a problem after clicking on the “Pay $39.00” blue button. Stripe notes that
we did not set a valid publishable key!
Chapter 14: Orders with Stripe
 278
Checkout Modal Error
This value needs to be passed into our template and while we could hard code this it’s
far better to pass in the value as a variable matching our environment variable setting.
In Django each template is rendered with context data provided by the views.py file.
By overriding get_context_data()241 we can elegantly pass this information in with
our TemplateView.
Update orders/views.py as follows.
241 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/class-based-views/mixins-simple/#django.views.generic.base.
ContextMixin.get_context_data
Chapter 14: Orders with Stripe
Code
# orders/views.py
from django.conf import settings # new
from django.views.generic.base import TemplateView
class OrdersPageView(TemplateView):
template_name = 'orders/purchase.html'
279
def get_context_data(self, **kwargs): # new
context = super().get_context_data(**kwargs)
context['stripe_key'] = settings.STRIPE_TEST_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
return context
Now refresh the web page and try again. It will “work” in that the button turns
green with a checkmark indicating payment went through. If you look at the Stripe
Dashboard and click on “Logs” under “Developers” in the left menu, you can see that
tokens were created.
Chapter 14: Orders with Stripe
 280
Stripe Dashboard Logs
But if you then click on “Payments” in the same lefthand menu, there are no charges.
So what’s happening?
Think back to the Stripe flow. We have used the publishable key to send the credit
card information to Stripe, and Stripe has sent us back a unique token for the order.
But we haven’t used that token yet to make a charge! Recall that we send an order
form to Stripe with the Publishable Key, Stripe validates it and sends back a token,
and then we process the charge using both the token and our own Secret Key.
That’s the missing charge piece which we’ll implement now.
Chapter 14: Orders with Stripe
 281
Charges
Creating a charge is not as hard as it seems. The first step is to make our payment
button a Django form so we can pass in additional information via a charge view that
we’ll define next. And since it is a POST we include the {% csrf_token %} for additional
security.
Code
<!-- templates/orders/purchase.html -->
{% extends '_base.html' %}
{% block title %}Orders{% endblock title %}
{% block content %}
<h1>Orders page</h1>
<p>Buy for $39.00</p>
<form action="{% url 'charge' %}" method="post">
{% csrf_token %}
<script src="https://checkout.stripe.com/checkout.js" class="stripe-button"
data-key="{{ stripe_key }}"
data-description="All Books"
data-amount="3900"
data-locale="auto">
</script>
</form>
{% endblock content %}
Note it will redirect to a charge page so let’s create that now.
Chapter 14: Orders with Stripe
Command Line
$ touch templates/orders/charge.html
Add some text to it.
Code
<!-- templates/orders/charge.html -->
{% extends '_base.html' %}
{% block title %}Charge{% endblock title %}
{% block content %}
<h2>Thank you for your order! You now have access to
<a href="{% url 'book_list' %}">All Books</a>.</h2>
{% endblock content %}
Then update our URL routes with the new orders/charge/ page.
Code
# orders/urls.py
from django.urls import path
from .views import OrdersPageView, charge # new
urlpatterns = [
path('charge/', charge, name='charge'), # new
path('', OrdersPageView.as_view(), name='orders'),
]
282
Chapter 14: Orders with Stripe
 283
Now for the “magic” logic which will occur in the orders/views.py file. Create a charge
view that receives the token from Stripe, makes the charge, and then redirects to the
charge page upon success.
At the top of the file import the stripe library we already installed. It will look for
a secret key called stripe.api_key which we can set to that value. Then also import
render242 which will be used for the function-based charge view.
Code
# orders/views.py
import stripe # new
from django.conf import settings
from django.views.generic.base import TemplateView
from django.shortcuts import render # new
stripe.api_key = settings.STRIPE_TEST_SECRET_KEY # new
class OrdersPageView(TemplateView):
template_name = 'orders/purchase.html'
def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
context = super().get_context_data(**kwargs)
context['stripe_key'] = settings.STRIPE_TEST_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
return context
def charge(request): # new
if request.method == 'POST':
charge = stripe.Charge.create(
amount=3900,
242 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/templates/#django.template.backends.base.Template.render
Chapter 14: Orders with Stripe
currency='usd',
description='Purchase all books',
source=request.POST['stripeToken']
)
return render(request, 'orders/charge.html')
284
The charge function-based view assumes a POST request: we are sending data to Stripe
here. We make a charge that includes the amount, currency, description, and crucially
the source which has the unique token Stripe generated for this transaction called
stripeToken. Then we return the request object and load the charge.html template.
Adding robust error handling here is probably warranted on a large site, but beyond
the scope of this chapter.
Ok, refresh the orders page at http://127.0.0.1:8000/orders/243. Click on the “Pay with
Card” button again and use the credit card number 4242 4242 4242 4242, an expiration
date in the future such as 01/22, and you’ll end up on our charge page.
243 http://127.0.0.1:8000/orders/
Charge Page
Chapter 14: Orders with Stripe
 285
To confirm a charge was actually made, go back to the Stripe dashboard under
“Payments” on the lefthand sidebar.
It worked!
Stripe Payment
Stripe + Permissions
There’s one last step we must implement and that’s to link up the order with a
change in the given user’s permissions. In other words, currently we are charging
$39 successfully but the user is not getting anything in return! There is still no access
to the individual books.
But this is easily fixed. Again we’ll focus solely on the orders/views.py file. At the
top import Permission and then under the charge we first access the appropriate
Chapter 14: Orders with Stripe
 286
permission which is called special_status. Then we find the current user using
request.user. And finally we add the given permission change to the user’s permission
set.
Here is what it looks like in code:
Code
# orders/views.py
import stripe
from django.conf import settings
from django.contrib.auth.models import Permission # new
from django.views.generic.base import TemplateView
from django.shortcuts import render
stripe.api_key = settings.STRIPE_TEST_SECRET_KEY
class OrdersPageView(TemplateView):
template_name = 'orders/purchase.html'
def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
context = super().get_context_data(**kwargs)
context['stripe_key'] = settings.STRIPE_TEST_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
return context
def charge(request): # new
# Get the permission
permission = Permission.objects.get(codename='special_status')
# Get user
u = request.user
Chapter 14: Orders with Stripe
 287
# Add to user's permission set
u.user_permissions.add(permission)
if request.method == 'POST':
charge = stripe.Charge.create(
amount=3900,
currency='usd',
description='Purchase all books',
source=request.POST['stripeToken']
)
return render(request, 'orders/charge.html')
To test this out log in with our testuser@email.com acccount. It does not have access
to this special permission which can be confirmed both within the Users section of
the Admin under “Permissions” and also by the simple fact that if you try to access
any individual books with this account, you won’t be able to!
Refresh the orders page and attempt to make a charge again. It will complete. Now
visit the books list page and you can click through to each individual book. Success!
Templates
The final step is to add a button that links to the Orders page from the Books page.
That means updating the books/book_list.html template by adding a Bootstrap styled
button. Since the URL name of the orders page is orders–recall that this was set in
orders/urls.py–we can use the url template tag to link to it.
The ultimate code is a one-line update at the top of the content in the file.
Chapter 14: Orders with Stripe
 288
Code
<!-- templates/books/book_list.html -->
{% extends '_base.html' %}
{% block title %}Books{% endblock title %}
{% block content %}
<a href="{% url 'orders' %}" class="btn btn-success" >Purchase All Books</a>
{% for book in book_list %}
<div>
<h2><a href="{{ book.get_absolute_url }}">{{ book.title }}</a></h2>
</div>
{% endfor %}
{% endblock content %}
Refresh the books page and the button is now visible.
Orders Link
Clicking on it redirects to the Orders page. An additional step would be to add
template logic that checks if the current logged-in user already has the proper
Chapter 14: Orders with Stripe
 289
permission, in which case the button would not be visible. That can be done by adding
an if statement and checking if a user has special_status permission.
Code
<!-- templates/books/book_list.html -->
{% extends '_base.html' %}
{% block title %}Books{% endblock title %}
{% block content %}
{% if not perms.books.special_status %}
<a href="{% url 'orders' %}" class="btn btn-success" >Purchase All Books</a>
{% endif %}
{% for book in book_list %}
<div>
<h2><a href="{{ book.get_absolute_url }}">{{ book.title }}</a></h2>
</div>
{% endfor %}
{% endblock content %}
Tests
Typically the next step would be to add testing, but this example highlights an
important point: it’s hard to test integrations that involve 3rd party services. Doing
so goes well beyond the abilities of core Django. However, it can be done with various
mocking libraries and potentially using a service like Cypress244 , but covering this is
well beyond the scope of the book.

Git
There have been a lot of code changes in this chapter so make sure to commit
everything with Git.
Command Line
$ git status
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'ch14'
And if you have any errors make sure to look at your logs with docker-compose logs
and compare your code with the official source code on Github245.
Conclusion
This chapter demonstrated how to add payments to a Django site. To review we used
Stripe Checkout and our publishable key to send a customer’s credit card information
to Stripe. The Stripe API then sent us back a unique token for the customer, which we
used alongside our secret key on the server to submit a charge. Alongside this charge
we also updated the given user’s permissions.
There are a number of additional steps that might be taken such as allowing payments
for an individual book, a bundle, and so on. The process is the same as what we’ve done
here: create a permission or even a group potentially and then link the charge to that.
