Chapter 16: Performance
The first priority for any website is that it must work properly and contain proper
tests. But if your project is fortunate enough to receive a large amount of traffic the
focus quickly shifts to performance and making things as efficient as possible. This is
a fun and challenging exercise for many engineers, but it can also be a trap.
The computer scientist Donald Knuth has a famous quote265 worth reading in its
entirety:
“The real problem is that programmers have spent far too much time worrying about
efficiency in the wrong places and at the wrong times; premature optimization is the
root of all evil (or at least most of it) in programming.”
While it’s important to set up proper monitoring so you can optimize your project later
on, don’t focus too much on it upfront. There’s no way to properly mimic production
environments locally. And there is no way to predict exactly how a site’s traffic will
look. But it is possible to spend far too much time seeking out tiny performance gains
in the early stages instead of talking to users and making larger code improvements!
In this chapter we’ll focus on the broad strokes of Django-related performance and
highlight areas worth further investigation at scale. Generally speaking performance
comes down to four major areas: optimizing database queries, caching, indexes, and
compressing front-end assets like images, JavaScript, and CSS.

django-debug-toolbar
Before we can optimize our database queries we need to see them. And for this
the default tool in the Django community is the third-party package django-debug-
toolbar266 . It comes with a configurable set of panels to inspect the complete re-
quest/response cycle of any given page.
Per usual we can install it within Docker and stop our running containers.
Command Line
$ docker-compose exec web pipenv install django-debug-toolbar==2.0
$ docker-compose down
There are three separate configurations to set in our bookstore_project/settings.py
file:
1. INSTALLED_APPS
2. Middleware
3. INTERNAL_IPS
First add Debug Toolbar to the INSTALLED_APPS configuration. Note that the proper
name is debug_toolbar not django_debug_toolbar as might be expected.
266 https://github.com/jazzband/django-debug-toolbar
Chapter 16: Performance
Code
# bookstore_project/settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
'django.contrib.admin',
'django.contrib.auth',
'django.contrib.contenttypes',
'django.contrib.sessions',
'django.contrib.messages',
'django.contrib.staticfiles',
'django.contrib.sites',
# Third-party
'crispy_forms',
'allauth',
'allauth.account',
'debug_toolbar', # new
305
]
# Local
'users.apps.UsersConfig',
'pages.apps.PagesConfig',
'books.apps.BooksConfig',
'orders.apps.OrdersConfig',
Second, add Debug Toolbar to the Middleware where it is primarily implemented.
Chapter 16: Performance
Code
# bookstore_project/settings.py
MIDDLEWARE = [
'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',
'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware',
'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',
'django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware',
'django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware',
'debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware', # new
]
306
And third, set the INTERNAL_IPS267 as well. If we were not in Docker this could be
set to '127.0.0.1', however, since we’re running our web server within Docker an
additional step is required so that it matches the machine address of Docker. Add the
following lines at the bottom of bookstore_project/settings.py.
Code
# bookstore_project/settings.py
...
# django-debug-toolbar
import socket
hostname, _, ips = socket.gethostbyname_ex(socket.gethostname())
INTERNAL_IPS = [ip[:-1] + "1" for ip in ips]
Phew. That looks a bit scary, but basically it ensures that our INTERNAL_IPS matches
that of our Docker host.
267 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/settings/#internal-ips
Chapter 16: Performance
 307
Now rebuild the base image so it contains the package and the updated settings
configuration.
Command Line
$ docker-compose up -d --build
There’s one last step and that is to update our URLconf. We only want Debug Toolbar
to appear if DEBUG is true so we’ll add logic to display it only in this case.
Code
# bookstore_project/urls.py
...
if settings.DEBUG:
import debug_toolbar
urlpatterns = [
path('__debug__/', include(debug_toolbar.urls)),
] + urlpatterns
Now if you refresh the homepage you’ll see the django-debug-toolbar on the righthand
side.

 308
Debug Toolbar
If you click the “Hide” link on top it becomes a much smaller sidebar on the righthand
side of the page.
Analyzing Pages
Debug Toolbar has many possible customizations268 but the default settings visible tell
us a lot about our homepage. For instance, we can see the current version of Django
being used as well as the Time it took to load the page. Also the specific request called
268 https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
Chapter 16: Performance
 309
which was HomePageView. This may seem obvious but on large codebases especially if
you are jumping in as a new developer, it may not be obvious which view is calling
which page. Debug Toolbar is a helpful quickstart to understanding existing sites.
Probably the most useful item, however, is SQL which shows two queries are being run
and the time for them. If you click on it even more data appears.
Debug Toolbar
Large and poorly optimized sites can have hundreds or even thousands of queries
being run on a single page!
Chapter 16: Performance
 310
select_related and prefetch_related
What are the options if you do find yourself working on a Django site with way too
many SQL queries per page? In general, though, fewer large queries will be faster than
many smaller queries, though it’s possible and required to test this in practice. Two
common techniques for doing so are select_related()269 and prefetch_related()270.
select_related is used for single-value relationships through a forward one-to-many
or a one-to-one relationship. It creates a SQL join and includes the fields of the related
object in the SELECT statement, which results in all related objects being included in a
single more complex database query. This single query is typically more performant
than multiple, smaller queries.
prefetch_related is used for a set or list of objects like a many-to-many or many-to-
one relationship. Under the hood a lookup is done for each relationship and the “join”
occurs in Python, not SQL. This allows it to prefetch many-to-many and many-to-one
objects, which cannot be done using select_related, in addition to the foreign key and
one-to-one relationships that are supported by select_related.
Implementing one or both on a website is a common first pass towards reducing
queries and loading time for a given page.
Caching
Consider that our Bookstore project is a dynamic website. Each time a user requests a
page our server has to make various calculations including database queries, template
rendering, and so on before servicing it. This takes time and is much slower than
simply reading a file from a static site where the content does not change.
269 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/models/querysets/#select-related
270 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/models/querysets/#prefetch-related
Chapter 16: Performance
 311
On large sites, though, this type of overhead can be quite slow and caching is one
of the first solutions in a web developer’s tool bag. Implementing caching on our
current project is definitely overkill, but we will nonetheless review the options and
implement a basic version.
A cache is an in-memory storing of an expensive calculation. Once executed it doesn’t
need to be run again! The two most popular options are Memcached271 which features
native Django support and Redis272 which is commonly implemented with the django-
redis273 third-party package.
Django has its own cache framework274 which includes four different caching options
in descending order of granularity:
1) The per-site cache275 is the simplest to set up and caches your entire site.
2) The per-view cache276 lets you cache individual views.
3) Template fragment caching277 lets you specify a specific section of a template to
cache.
4) The low-level cache API278 lets you manually set, retrieve, and maintain specific
objects in the cache.
Why not just cache everything all the time? One reason is that cache memory is
expensive, as it’s stored as RAM: think about the cost of going from 8GB to 16GB of
RAM on your laptop vs. 256GB to 512GB of hard drive space. Another is the cache must
be “warm,” that is filled with updated content, so depending upon the needs of a site,
optimizing the cache so it is accurate, but not wasteful, takes quite a bit of tuning.

Chapter 16: Performance
 312
If you wanted to implement per-site caching, which is the simplest approach, you’d
add UpdateCacheMiddleware at the very top of the MIDDLEWARE configuration in bookstore_-
project/settings.py and FetchFromCacheMiddleware at the very bottom. Also set three
additional fields CACHE_MIDDLEWARE_ALIAS 279 , CACHE_MIDDLEWARE_SECONDS280and CACHE_MIDDLEWARE_KEY_PREFIX281 .
Code
# bookstore_project/settings.py
MIDDLEWARE = [
'django.middleware.cache.UpdateCacheMiddleware', # new
'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',
'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
'debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware',
'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware',
'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',
'django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware',
'django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware',
'debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware',
'django.middleware.cache.FetchFromCacheMiddleware', # new
]
,
CACHE_MIDDLEWARE_ALIAS = 'default'
CACHE_MIDDLEWARE_SECONDS = 604800
CACHE_MIDDLEWARE_KEY_PREFIX = ''
The only default you might want to adjust is CACHE_MIDDLEWARE_SECONDS which is the
default number of seconds (600) to cache a page. After the period is up, the cache
279 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/settings/#std:setting-CACHE_MIDDLEWARE_ALIAS
280 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/settings/#cache-middleware-seconds
281 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/settings/#cache-middleware-key-prefix
Chapter 16: Performance
 313
expires and becomes empty. A good default when starting out is 604800 seconds or
1 week (60secs x 60minutes x 168hours) for a site with content that doesn’t change
very often. But if you find your cache filling up rapidly or you are running a site where
the content changes on a frequent basis, shortening this setting is a good first step.
Implementing caching is strictly optional at this point though. Once a website is up
and running the need for caching–per site, per page, and so on–will quickly become
apparent. There is also extra complexity as Memcache must be run as a separate
instance. On the hosting service Heroku, which we’ll use in chapter 18 for deployment,
there is a free tier available via Memcachier282.
Indexes
Indexing283 is a common technique for speeding up database performance. It is a
separate data structure that allows faster searches and is typically only applied to
the primary key in a model. The downside is that indexes require additional space on
a disk so they must be used with care.
Tempting as it is to simply add indexes to primary keys from the beginning, it is better
to start without them and only add them later based on production needs. A general
rule of thumb is that if a given field is being used frequently, such as 10-25% of all
queries, it is a prime candidate to be indexed.
Historically an index field could be created by adding db_index=True to any model
field. For example, if we wanted to add one to the id field in our Book model it would
look as follows (don’t actually implement this though).
282 https://elements.heroku.com/addons/memcachier
283 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_index
Chapter 16: Performance
Code
# books/models.py
...
class Book(models.Model):
id = models.UUIDField(
primary_key=True,
db_index=True, # new
default=uuid.uuid4,
editable=False)
...
314
This change would need to be added via a migration file and migrated.
Starting in Django 1.11284 class-based model indexes were added so can include in the
Meta section instead285 . So you could write the previous index as follows:
Code
# books/models.py
...
class Book(models.Model):
id = models.UUIDField(
primary_key=True,
default=uuid.uuid4,
editable=False)
...
class Meta:
indexes = [ # new

285 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/models/options/#indexes
Chapter 16: Performance
models.Index(fields=['id'], name='id_index'),
]
permissions = [
("special_status", "Can read all books"),
]
315
Since we’ve changed the model we must create a migrations file and apply it.
Command Line
$ docker-compose exec web python manage.py makemigrations books
$ docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
django-extensions
Another very popular third-party package for inspecting a Django project is django-
extensions286 which adds a number of helpful custom extensions287.
One that is particularly helpful is shell_plus288 which will autoload all models into the
shell which makes working with the Django ORM much easier.
Front-end Assets
A final major source of bottlenecks in a website is loading front-end assets. CSS and
JavaScript can become quite large and therefore tools like django-compressor289 can
help to minimize their size.

Images are often the first place to look in terms of asset size. The static/media file set
up we have in place will scale to a quite large size, but for truly large sites it is worth
investigating the use of a Content Delivery Network (CDN)290 for images instead of
storing them on the server filesystem.
You can also serve different size images to users. For example, rather than shrink
down a large book cover for a list or search page you could store a smaller thumbnail
version instead and serve that where needed. The third-party easy-thumbnails291
package is a good place to start for this.
A fantastic free e-book on the topic is Essential Image Optimization292 by Addy
Osmani that goes into depth on image optimization and automations.
As a final check there are automated tests for front-end speed such as Google’s
PageSpeed Insights 293 that will assign a score based on how quickly a page loads.
Git
There’s been a lot of code changes in this chapter so make sure to commit everything
with Git.

Conclusion
There is an almost endless list of performance optimizations that can be applied to
a project. But take care to recall Donald Knuth’s sage advice and not go too crazy on
this. Bottlenecks will reveal themselves in production and should largely be addressed
then; not in advance.
You should remember that performance problems are a good problem to have! They
are fixable and mean that your project is being heavily used.
