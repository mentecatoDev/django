Chapter 6: Static Assets
Static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images are a core component of any website and
Django provides us with a large degree of flexibility around their configuration and
storage. In this chapter we’ll configure our initial static assets and add Bootstrap115 to
our project for improved styling.
staticfiles app
Django relies on the staticfiles app116 to manage static files from across our entire
project, make them accessible for rapid local development on the file system, and also
combine them into a single location that can be served in a better performing manner
in production. This process and the distinction between local and production static
files confuses many Django newcomers.
To start we’ll update the staticfiles app117 configuration in settings.py.
STATIC_URL
The first static file setting, STATIC_URL118 , is already included for us in the bookstore_-
project/settings.py file.
115 https://getbootstrap.com/
116 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/contrib/staticfiles/
117 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/settings/#static-files
118 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/settings/#static-url
Chapter 6: Static Assets
 113
Code

# bookstore_project/settings.py
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
This sets the URL that we can use to use to reference static files. Note that it is
important to include a trailing slash / at the end of the directory name.
STATICFILES_DIRS
Next up is STATICFILES_DIRS119 which defines the location of static files in local
development. In our project these will all live within a top-level static directory.
Code
# bookstore_project/settings.py
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'),] # new
It’s often the case that there will be multiple directories with static files within a
project so Python brackets [], which denote a list120, are typically added here to
accommodate future additions.
STATIC_ROOT
STATIC_ROOT121 is the location of static files for production so it must be set to
a different name, typically staticfiles. When it comes time to deploy a Django
project, the collectstatic122 command will automatically compile all available static
119 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/settings/#staticfiles-dirs

122 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/contrib/staticfiles/#django-admin-collectstatic
Chapter 6: Static Assets
 114
files throughout the entire project into a single directory. This is far faster than having
static files sprinkled across the project as is the case in local development.
Code
# bookstore_project/settings.py
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'),]
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles') # new
STATICFILES_FINDERS
The last setting is STATICFILES_FINDERS123 which tells Django how to look for static
file directories. It is implicitly set for us and although this is an optional step, I prefer
to make it explicit in all projects.
Code
# bookstore_project/settings.py
STATICFILES_FINDERS = [
"django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.FileSystemFinder",
"django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.AppDirectoriesFinder",
]
The FileSystemFinder looks within the STATICFILES_DIRS setting, which we set to
static, for any static files. Then the AppDirectoriesFinder looks for any directories
named static located within an app, as opposed to located at a project-level static
directory. This setting is read top-to-bottom meaning if a file called static/img.jpg
is first found by FileSystemFinder it will be in place of an img.jpg file located within,
say, the pages app at pages/static/img.jpg.
123 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/settings/#staticfiles-finders
Chapter 6: Static Assets
Our final group of settings therefore should look as follows:
Code
# bookstore_project/settings.py
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'),]
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
STATICFILES_FINDERS = [
"django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.FileSystemFinder",
"django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.AppDirectoriesFinder",
]
115
Static Directory
Let’s now add some static files and incorporate them into our project. Even though
we’re referring to a static directory for our files it’s up to us to create it so do that
now along with new subdirectories for CSS, JavaScript, and images.
Command Line
$ mkdir static
$ mkdir static/css
$ mkdir static/js
$ mkdir static/images
Next create a base.css file.
Chapter 6: Static Assets
 116
Command Line
$ touch static/css/base.css
We’ll keep things basic and have our h1 headline be red. The point is to show how CSS
can be added to our project, not to delve too deeply into CSS itself.
Code
/* static/css/base.css */
h1 {
color: red;
}
If you refresh the homepage now you’ll see that nothing has changed. That’s because
static assets must be explicitly loaded into the templates. First load all static files at
the top of the page with {% load static %} and then include a link to the base.css file.
The static124 template tag uses STATIC_URL, which we set to /static/, so rather than
needing to write out static/css/base.css we can simply refer to css/base.css.
Code
<!-- templates/_base.html -->
{% load static %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>{% block title %}Bookstore{% endblock %}</title>
<!-- CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'css/base.css' %}">
124 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/templates/builtins/#std:templatetag-static
Chapter 6: Static Assets
</head>
...
Refresh the homepage to see our work. There’s our CSS in action!
117
Homepage with red text
If instead you see an error screen saying Invalid block tag on line 7: 'static'.
Did you forget to register or load this tag? then you forgot to include the line {%
load static %} at the top of the file. I do this all the time myself.
Images
How about an image? You can download the book cover for Django for Professionals at
this link125 . Save it into the directory books/static/images as djangoforprofessionals.jpg.
To display it on the homepage, update templates/home.html. Add both the {% load
static %} tags at the top and on the next-to-last line the <img> link for the file.
125 https://wsvincent.com/assets/images/djangoforprofessionals.jpg
Chapter 6: Static Assets
Code
<!-- templates/home.html -->
{% extends '_base.html' %}
{% load static %}
{% block title %}Home{% endblock title %}
118
{% block content %}
<h1>Homepage</h1>
<img class="bookcover" src="{% static 'images/djangoforprofessionals.jpg' %}">
{% if user.is_authenticated %}
<p>Hi {{ user.email }}!</p>
<p><a href="{% url 'logout' %}">Log Out</a></p>
{% else %}
<p>You are not logged in</p>
<p><a href="{% url 'login' %}">Log In</a> |
<a href="{% url 'signup' %}">Sign Up</a></p>
{% endif %}
{% endblock content %}
Refreshing the homepage you’ll see the raw file is quite large! Let’s control that with
some additional CSS.
Chapter 6: Static Assets
Code
/* static/css/base.css */
h1 {
color: red;
}
.bookcover {
height: 300px;
width: auto;
}
Now update the homepage and the book cover image fits nicely.

Homepage with Book Cover
Chapter 6: Static Assets
 120
JavaScript
To add JavaScript we’ll go through a similar process. Create a new file called base.js.
Command Line
$ touch static/js/base.js
Often I put a tracking code of some kind here, such as for Google Analytics, but for
demonstration purposes we’ll add a console.log statement so we can confirm the
JavaScript loaded correctly.
Code
// static/js/base.js
console.log('JavaScript here!')
Now add it to our _base.html template. JavaScript should be added at the bottom of
the file so it is loaded last, after the HTML, CSS, and other assets that appear first
on the screen when rendered in the web browser. This gives the appearance of the
complete webpage loading faster.
Chapter 6: Static Assets
Code
<!-- templates/_base.html -->
{% load static %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>{% block title %}Bookstore{% endblock title %}</title>
<!-- CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'css/base.css' %}">
</head>
<body>
<div class="container">
{% block content %}
{% endblock content %}
</div>
<!-- JavaScript -->
{% block javascript %}
<script src="{% static 'js/base.js' %}"></script>
{% endblock javascript %}
</body>
</html>
121
In your web browser, make the JavaScript console available. This involves opening up
Developer Tools and making sure you’re on the “Console” section. On Chrome which
is being used for the images in this book, go to View in the top menu, then Developer
-> Developer Tools which will open a sidebar. Make sure Console is selected from the
options.
If you refresh the page, you should see the following:
Chapter 6: Static Assets
 122
Homepage JavaScript console view
collectstatic
Imagine we wanted to deploy our website right away. Among other steps, we’d need
to run collectstatic126 to create a single, production-ready directory of all the static
files in our project.
Command Line
$ docker-compose exec web python manage.py collectstatic
122 static files copied to '/code/staticfiles'.
If you look within your text editor, there is now a staticfiles directory with four
subdirectories: admin, css, images, and js. The first one is the static assets of the Django
admin app and the other three we specified. That’s why there are 122 files copied over.
126 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/contrib/staticfiles/#collectstatic
Chapter 6: Static Assets
 123
Bootstrap
Writing custom CSS for your website is a worthy goal and something I advise
all software developers, even back-end ones, to try at some point. But practically
speaking there is a reason front-end frameworks like Bootstrap127 exist: they save you
a ton of time when starting a new project. Unless you have a dedicated designer to
collaborate with, stick with a framework for the early iterations of your website.
In this section we’ll add Bootstrap to our project alongside our existing base.css file.
Typing all this out by hand would take a while and be error prone so this is a rare case
where I advise simply copy/pasting from the official source code128 .
Note that order matters here for both the CSS and JavaScript. The file will be loaded
top-to-bottom so our base.css file comes after the Bootstrap CSS so our h1 style
overrides the Bootstrap default. At the bottom of the file, it’s similarly important to
load jQuery first, then PopperJS, and only then the Bootstrap JavaScript file.
Finally observe that a navigation header has been added to the project with basic logic
so if a user is logged in, only the “Log Out” link is visible while a logged out user will
see both “Log In” and “Sign Up” links.

125
It’s best not to attempt to type this code. Instead copy and paste it from the official
repo129 with one noticeable change: on line 18 of the source code, make sure to change
the href tag to # not {% url 'about' %}. In other words it should match the above code
and look like this:
129 https://github.com/wsvincent/djangoforprofessionals/blob/master/ch6-static-assets/templates/_base.html
Chapter 6: Static Assets
 126
Code
<!-- templates/_base.html -->
<a class="p-2 text-dark" href="#">About</a>
We’ll add the about page URL route in the next section. If you refresh the homepage
after making these changes it should look as follows:
Homepage with Bootstrap
About Page
Did you notice the navbar link for an About page? Trouble is the page and the link don’t
exist yet. But because we already have a handy pages app it’s quite quick to make one.
Since this will be a static page we don’t need a database model involved. However we
will need a template, view, and url. Let’s start with the template called about.html.
Chapter 6: Static Assets
 127
Command Line
$ touch templates/about.html
The page will literally just say “About Page” for now while inheriting from _base.html.
Code
<!-- templates/about.html -->
{% extends '_base.html' %}
{% block title %}About{% endblock title %}
{% block content %}
<h1>About Page</h1>
{% endblock content %}
The view can rely on Django’s built-in TemplateView just like our homepage.
Code
# pages/views.py
from django.views.generic import TemplateView
class HomePageView(TemplateView):
template_name = 'home.html'
class AboutPageView(TemplateView): # new
template_name = 'about.html'
And the URL path will be pretty similar as well. Set it to about/, import the appropriate
view, and provide a URL name of about.
Chapter 6: Static Assets
Code
# pages/urls.py
from django.urls import path
from .views import HomePageView, AboutPageView # new
128
urlpatterns = [
path('about/', AboutPageView.as_view(), name='about'), # new
path('', HomePageView.as_view(), name='home'),
]
If you go now to http://127.0.0.1:8000/about/130 you can see the About page.
About Page
As a final step, update the link in the navbar to the page. Because we provided a name
in the URL path of about that’s what we’ll use.
On line 18 of _base.html change the line with the About page link to the following:
130 http://127.0.0.1:8000/about/
Chapter 6: Static Assets
Code
<!-- templates/_base.html -->
<a class="p-2 text-dark" href="{% url 'about' %}">About</a>
129
Django Crispy Forms
One last update concerns our forms. The popular 3rd party package django-crispy-
forms131 provides a host of welcome upgrades.
We’ll follow the usual pattern to install it which is: install within Docker, stop our
Docker container and then rebuild it.
Command Line
$ docker-compose exec web pipenv install django-crispy-forms==1.8.0
$ docker-compose down
$ docker-compose up -d --build
Now add crispy forms to the INSTALLED_APPS setting. Note that it’s name needs to be
cripsy_forms here. A nice additional feature is to specify bootstrap4 under CRISPY_-
TEMPLATE_PACK which will provide pre-styled forms for us.
131 https://github.com/django-crispy-forms/django-crispy-forms
Chapter 6: Static Assets
Code
# bookstore_project/settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
'django.contrib.admin',
'django.contrib.auth',
'django.contrib.contenttypes',
'django.contrib.sessions',
'django.contrib.messages',
'django.contrib.staticfiles',
# Third-party
'crispy_forms', # new
130
]
# Local
'users.apps.UsersConfig',
'pages.apps.PagesConfig',
# django-crispy-forms
CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK = 'bootstrap4' # new
To use Crispy Forms we load crispy_forms_tags at the top of a template and add {{
form|crispy }} to replace {{ form.as_p}} for displaying form fields. We will take this
time to also add Bootstrap styling to the Submit button.
Start with templates/signup.html. Make the updates below.
Chapter 6: Static Assets
Code
<!-- templates/signup.html -->
{% extends '_base.html' %}
{% load crispy_forms_tags %}
{% block title %}Sign Up{% endblock title %}
{% block content %}
<h2>Sign Up</h2>
<form method="post">
{% csrf_token %}
{{ form|crispy }}
<button class="btn btn-success" type="submit">Sign Up</button>
</form>
{% endblock content %}
131
Chapter 6: Static Assets
 132
Sign Up Page with Crispy Forms
Update login.html as well with crispy_forms_tags at the top and {{ form|crispy }}
in the form.
Chapter 6: Static Assets
Code
<!-- templates/registration/login.html -->
{% extends '_base.html' %}
{% load crispy_forms_tags %}
{% block title %}Log In{% endblock title %}
{% block content %}
<h2>Log In</h2>
<form method="post">
{% csrf_token %}
{{ form|crispy }}
<button class="btn btn-success" type="submit">Log In</button>
</form>
{% endblock content %}

Tests
Time for tests which will be very similar to those we added previously for our
homepage.
Code
# pages/tests.py
from django.test import SimpleTestCase
from django.urls import reverse, resolve
from .views import HomePageView, AboutPageView # new
class HomepageTests(SimpleTestCase):
...
class AboutPageTests(SimpleTestCase): # new

url = reverse('about')
self.response = self.client.get(url)
def test_aboutpage_status_code(self):
self.assertEqual(self.response.status_code, 200)
def test_aboutpage_template(self):
self.assertTemplateUsed(self.response, 'about.html')
Chapter 6: Static Assets
def test_aboutpage_contains_correct_html(self):
self.assertContains(self.response, 'About Page')
def test_aboutpage_does_not_contain_incorrect_html(self):
self.assertNotContains(
self.response, 'Hi there! I should not be on the page.')
def test_aboutpage_url_resolves_aboutpageview(self):
view = resolve('/about/')
self.assertEqual(
view.func.__name__,
AboutPageView.as_view().__name__
)
Run the tests.

Git
Check the status of our changes in this chapter, add them all, and then provide a
commit message.
Command Line
$ git status
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'ch6'
As alway you can compare your code with the official code on Github132 if there are
any issues.
Conclusion
Static assets are a core part of every website and in Django we have to take a number
of additional steps so they are compiled and hosted efficiently in production. Later
on in the book we’ll learn how to use a dedicated content delivery network (CDN) for
hosting and displaying our project’s static files.

Chapter 7: Advanced User Registration
At this point we have the standard Django user registration implemented. But often
that’s just the starting point on professional projects. What about customizing things
a bit? For example, Django’s default username/email/password pattern is somewhat
dated these days. It’s far more common to simply require email/password for sign up
and log in. And really every part of the authentication flow–the forms, emails, pages–
can be customized if so desired.
Another major factor in many projects is the need for social authentication, that is
handling sign up and log in via a third-party service like Google, Facebook, and so on.
We could implement our own solutions here from scratch but there are some definite
risks: user registration is a complex area with many moving parts and one area where
we really do not want to make a security mistake.
For this reason, many professional Django developers rely on the popular third-
party django-allauth133 . Adding any third party package should come with a degree
of caution since you are adding another dependency to your technical stack. It’s
important to make sure any package is both up-to-date and well tested. Fortunately
django-allauth is both.
At the cost of a little bit of magic it addresses all of these concerns and makes
customization much, much easier.

django-allauth
Start by installing django-allauth. Because we’re using Pipenv we want to avoid
conflicts with the Pipfile.lock so we’ll install it within Dock
