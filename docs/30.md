Chapter 12: File/Image Uploads
We previously configured static assets such as images in Chapter 6, but user-
uploaded files, such as book covers, are somewhat different. To start with, Django
refers to the former as static whereas anything uploaded by a user, whether it be a
file or an image, is referred to as media.
The process for adding this feature for files or images is similar, but for images the
Python image processing library Pillow210 must be installed which includes additional
features such as basic validation.
Let’s install pillow using our by-now-familiar pattern of installing it within Docker,
stopping our containers, and forcing a build of the new image.
Command Line
$ docker-compose exec web pipenv install pillow==6.2.1
$ docker-compose down
$ docker-compose up -d --build
Media Files
Fundamentally the difference between static and media files is that we can trust the
former, but we definitely can’t trust the latter by default. There are always security
concerns211 when dealing with user-uploaded content212. Notably, it’s important to
validate all uploaded files to ensure they are what they say they are. There are a

number of nasty ways a malicious actor can attack a website that blindly accepts user
uploads.
To start let’s add two new configurations to the bookstore_project/settings.py file.
By default MEDIA_URL and MEDIA_ROOT are empty and not displayed so we need to
configure them:
• MEDIA_ROOT213 is the absolute file system path to the directory for user-
uploaded files
• MEDIA_URL214 is the URL we can use in our templates for the files
For convenience lump the static and media file configurations together so add both
of these settings after STATICFILES_FINDERS near the bottom of the file. We’ll use the
common convention of calling both media. Don’t forget to include the trailing slash /
for MEDIA_URL!
Code

# bookstore_project/settings.py
MEDIA_URL = '/media/' # new
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media') # new
Next add a new directory called media and a subdirectory called covers within it.
Command Line
$ mkdir media
$ mkdir media/covers
And finally since user-uploaded content is assumed to exist in a production context,
to see media items locally we need to update bookstore_project/urls.py to show the
files locally. This involves importing both settings and static at the top and then
adding an additional line at the bottom.

Chapter 12: File/Image Uploads
Code
# bookstore_project/urls.py
from django.conf import settings # new
from django.conf.urls.static import static # new
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include
urlpatterns = [
# Django admin
path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
236
# User management
path('accounts/', include('allauth.urls')),
# Local apps
path('', include('pages.urls')),
path('books/', include('books.urls')),
] + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT) # new
Models
With our generic media configuration out of the way we can now turn to our models.
To store these images we’ll use Django’s ImageField215 which comes with some basic
image processing validation included.
The name of the field is cover and we specify the location of the uploaded image will be
in MEDIA_ROOT/covers (the MEDIA_ROOT part is implied based on our earlier settings.py
config).

Chapter 12: File/Image Uploads
Code
# books/models.py
class Book(models.Model):
id = models.UUIDField(
primary_key=True,
default=uuid.uuid4,
editable=False)
title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
author = models.CharField(max_length=200)
price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=6, decimal_places=2)
cover = models.ImageField(upload_to='covers/') # new
def__str__(self):
return self.title
def get_absolute_url(self):
return reverse('book_detail', kwargs={'pk': str(self.pk)})
237
If we wanted to allow uploads of a regular file rather than an image file the only
difference could be to change ImageField to FileField.
Since we’ve updated the model it’s time to create a migrations file.
Chapter 12: File/Image Uploads
 238
Command Line
$ docker-compose exec web python manage.py makemigrations books
You are trying to add a non-nullable field 'cover_image' to book
without a default; we can't do that (the database needs something to populate
existing rows).
Please select a fix:
1) Provide a one-off default now (will be set on all existing rows with a
null value for this column)
2) Quit, and let me add a default in models.py
Select an option:
Oops! What happened? We’re adding a new database field, but we already have three
entries in our database for each book. Yet we failed to set a default value for cover.
To fix this type 2 to quit and we’ll add a blank216 field set to True for existing images.
Code
# bookstore_project/models.py
cover = models.ImageField(upload_to='covers/', blank=True) # new
It’s common to see blank and nulla used together to set a default value on a field. A
gotcha is that the field type – ImageField vs. CharField and so on – dictates how to use
them properly so closely read the documentation for future use.

Now we can create a migrations file without errors.

Command Line
$ docker-compose exec web python manage.py makemigrations books
Migrations for 'books':

And then apply the migration to our database.

Admin
We’re in the home stretch now! Navigate over to the admin and to the entry for the
book “Django for Professionals.” The cover field is visible already and we already have
a copy of it locally within static/images/djangoforprofessionals.jpg so use that file
for the upload and then click the “Save” button in bottom right.

Admin add cover
This will redirect back to the main Books section. Click on the link again for “Django
for Profesionals” and we can see it currently exists in our desired location of covers/.

 241
Admin with cover
Template
OK, final step. Let’s update our template to display the book cover on the individual
page. The route will be book.cover.url pointing to the location of the cover in our file
system.
Chapter 12: File/Image Uploads
 242
Here’s what the updated book_detail.html file looks like with this one line change
above the title.
Code
# templates/books/book_detail.html
{% extends '_base.html' %}
{% block title %}{{ book.title }}{% endblock title %}
{% block content %}
<div class="book-detail">
<img class="bookcover" src="{{ book.cover.url}}" alt="{{ book.title }}">
<h2><a href="">{{ book.title }}</a></h2>
<p>Author: {{ book.author }}</p>
<p>Price: {{ book.price }}</p>
<div>
<h3>Reviews</h3>
<ul>
{% for review in book.reviews.all %}
<li>{{ review.review }} ({{ review.author }})</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
</div>
</div>
{% endblock content %}
If you now visit the page for “Django for Professionals” you’ll see the cover image
proudly there!
Chapter 12: File/Image Uploads
 243
Cover image
One potential gotcha is that our template now expects a cover to be present. If you
navigate to either of the two other books, for which we have not added a cover, you’ll
see the following error message.
Chapter 12: File/Image Uploads
 244
Cover image error
We must add some basic logic to our template so that if a cover is not present the
template doesn’t look for it! This can be done using an if statement that checks for
book.cover and displays it if it exists.
Code
# templates/books/book_detail.html
{% extends '_base.html' %}
{% block title %}{{ book.title }}{% endblock title %}
{% block content %}
<div class="book-detail">
{% if book.cover %}
<img class="bookcover" src="{{ book.cover.url}}" alt="{{ book.title }}">
{% endif %}
<p>Author: {{ book.author }}</p>
Chapter 12: File/Image Uploads

...
If you refresh either book page now you’ll see they display the correct page albeit
without a cover.
Next Steps
There are several additional steps that might be nice to take in a project, but are
beyond the scope of this book. These include adding dedicated create/edit/delete
forms for the creation of books and cover image. A quite lengthy list of extra
validations can and should be placed on the image-uploading form to ensure that
only a normal image is added to the database.
A further step would be to store media files in a dedicated CDN (Content Delivery
Network) for additional security. This can also be helpful for performance on very
large sites for static files, but for media files is a good idea regardless of the size.
Finally tests would be nice to have here although they would be primarily focused on
the form validation section, not the basic image-uploading via the admin. Again this
is an area that can become quite complex, but is worthy of further study.

Conclusion
This chapter demonstrated how to add user files to a project. In practice it is
straightforward, but the additional layer of security concerns makes it an area worthy
of focus at scale.
In the next chapter we will add permissions to our site to lock it down.
