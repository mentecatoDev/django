 Chapter 18: Deployment
So far we have been working entirely in a local development environment on our com-
puter. But now it is time to deploy our project so that it is accessible to the public. In
truth the topic of deployment is worth an entire book on its own. Compared to other
web frameworks Django is very hands-off and agnostic on the topic. There are no
one-click deploys for most hosting platforms and while this requires more developer
work it also allows, in typical Django fashion, for a high degree of customization.
In the previous chapter we configured a completely separate docker-compose-prod.yml
file and updated bookstore_project/settings.py to be production-ready. In this
chapter we’ll review how to choose a hosting provider, add a production-ready web
server, and properly configure static/media files before deploying our Bookstore site!
PaaS vs IaaS
The first question is whether to use a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) or Infrastructure-
as-a-Service (IaaS). A PaaS is an opinionated hosting option that handles much of
the initial configuration and scaling needed for a website. Popular examples include
Heroku344, PythonAnywhere345, and Dokku346 among many others. While a PaaS costs
more money upfront than an IaaS it saves an incredible amount of developer time,
handles security updates automatically, and can be quickly scaled.
An IaaS by contrast provides total flexibility is typically cheaper, but it requires a high
degree of knowledge and effort to properly set up. Prominent IaaS options include

Chapter 18: Deployment
 338
DigitalOcean347, Linode348 , Amazon EC2349 , and Google Compute Engine350 among
many others.
So which one to use? Django developers tend to fall in one of two camps: either they
already have a deployment pipeline configured with their IaaS of choice or they use a
PaaS. Since the former is far more complex and varies widely in its configuration, we
will use a PaaS in this book, specifically Heroku.
The choice of Heroku is somewhat arbitrary, but it is a mature technology that comes
with a truly free tier sufficient for deploying our Bookstore project.
WhiteNoise
For local development Django relies on the staticfiles app351 to automatically gather
and serve static files from across the entire project. This is convenient, but quite
inefficient and likely insecure, too.
For production the collectstatic352 must be run to compile all static files into a
single directory specified by STATIC_ROOT353 . They can then be served either on
the same server, a separate server, or a dedicated cloud service/CDN by updating
STATICFILES_STORAGE354 .
While it is tempting to jump right to a dedicated CDN beware premature optimization:
the default option of serving from your server’s filesystem scales to a quite large size.
If you decide to go this route the django-storages355 project is a popular approach.

Chapter 18: Deployment
 339
In our project we will rely on serving files from our server with the aid of the
WhiteNoise356 project which works extremely well on Heroku and is both faster and
more configurable than Django defaults.
The first step is to install whitenoise within Docker and stop the running containers.
Command Line
$ docker-compose exec web pipenv install whitenoise==4.1.4
$ docker-compose down
We won’t rebuild the image just yet because we also have to make changes to our
settings. Since we’re using Docker it’s possible to switch to WhiteNoise locally as
well as in production. While it’s possible to do this by passing in a --nostatic flag
to the runserver command, this becomes tiring in practice. A better approach is
to add whitenoise.runserver_nostatic before django.contrib.stataticfiles in the
INSTALLED_APPS config which will do the same thing. We’ll also add it to our MIDDLEWARE
right below SecurityMiddleware.
Code
# bookstore_project/settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
'django.contrib.admin',
'django.contrib.auth',
'django.contrib.contenttypes',
'django.contrib.sessions',
'django.contrib.messages',
'whitenoise.runserver_nostatic', # new
'django.contrib.staticfiles',
'django.contrib.sites',
356 https://github.com/evansd/whitenoise
Chapter 18: Deployment
 340
...
]
MIDDLEWARE = [
'django.middleware.cache.UpdateCacheMiddleware',
'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware', # new
...
]
With all our changes made we can now start up our project again in local development
mode.
Command Line
$ docker-compose up -d --build
WhiteNoise has additional options to serve compressed content and far-future
cache headers on content that won’t change. But for now, go ahead and run the
collectstatic command one more time.
Command Line
$ docker-compose exec web python manage.py collectstatic
There will be a warning about overwriting existing files. That’s fine. Type “yes” and
then hit the “Return” key to continue.
Chapter 18: Deployment
 341
Gunicorn
When we ran the startproject command way back in Chapter 3 a wsgi.py file was
created with a default WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface)357 configuration. This is
a specification for how a web app (like our Bookstore project) communicates with a
web server.
For production it is common to swap this out for either Gunicorn358 or uWSGI359 . Both
offer a performance boost, but Gunicorn is more focused and simpler to implement
so it will be our choice.
The first step is to install it within our project and stopping our containers.
Command Line
$ docker-compose exec web pipenv install gunicorn==19.9.0
$ docker-compose down
Because we are using Docker our local environment can mimic production quite
easily so we’ll update both docker-compose.yml and docker-compose-prod.yml to use
Gunicorn instead of the local server.
docker-compose.yml
# command: python /code/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
command: gunicorn bookstore_project.wsgi -b 0.0.0.0:8000 # new
357 https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
358 https://gunicorn.org/
359 https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
Chapter 18: Deployment
 342
docker-compose-prod.yml
# command: python /code/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
command: gunicorn bookstore_project.wsgi -b 0.0.0.0:8000 # new
Now start up the containers again building a new image with the Gunicorn package
and our updated environment variables.
Command Line
$ docker-compose up -d --build
dj-database-url
We will ultimately spin up a dedicated PostgreSQL database within Heroku for our de-
ployment. The way database information is supplied to Heroku is via an environment
variable named DATABASE_URL. We can use the dj-database-url360 package to parse
the DATABASE_URL environment variable and automatically convert it to the proper
configuration format.
For the last time in this book, install the package within Docker and then stop the
containers.
Command Line
$ docker-compose exec web pipenv install dj-database-url==0.5.0
$ docker-compose down
Then add three lines to the bottom of the bookstore_project/settings.py file.
360 https://github.com/kennethreitz/dj-database-url
Chapter 18: Deployment
Code
# bookstore_project/settings.py
# Heroku
import dj_database_url
db_from_env = dj_database_url.config(conn_max_age=500)
DATABASES['default'].update(db_from_env)
343
And then build our new image, start the containers, and load the updated settings
into our project.
Command Line
$ docker-compose up -d --build
We’re done with local changes and can now fully switch over to deploying with
Heroku.
Heroku
Head over to the Heroku361 website and sign up for a free account. After you confirm
your email Heroku will redirect you to the dashboard section of the site.
361 https://www.heroku.com/
Chapter 18: Deployment
 344
Heroku Dashboard
Next make sure to install Heroku’s Command Line Interface (CLI) so we can deploy
from the command line. There are detailed instructions here362 .
The final step is to log in with your Heroku credentials via the command line by typing
heroku login. Use the email and password for Heroku you just set.
Command Line
$ heroku login
All set! If you have any issues you can type heroku help on the command line or visit
the Heroku site for additional information.
Deploying with Docker
Now we are presented with a choice: deploy the traditional way on Heroku or with
Docker containers. The latter is a new approach Heroku and other hosting providers
362 https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python#set-up
Chapter 18: Deployment
 345
have only recently added. However, just as Docker has taken over local development,
it is starting to take over deployments as well. And once you’ve configured containers
for deployment it is far easy to switch between potential hosting providers rather
than if you configure their specific way. So we will deploy with Docker containers.
Even then we have, yet again, a choice to make as there are two different container
options available363 : using a container registry to deploy pre-built images or adding a
heroku.yml file. We will use the latter approach as it will allow additional commands
and more closely mimics the traditional Heroku approach of adding a Procfile for
configuration.
heroku.yml
Traditional non-Docker Heroku relies on a custom Procfile for configuring a site for
deployment. For containers Heroku relies on a similar approach of a custom file but
called heroku.yml364 in the root directory. It is similar to docker-compose.yml which is
used for building local Docker containers.
Let’s create our heroku.yml file now.
Command Line
$ touch heroku.yml
There are four top-level sections365 available for configuration: setup, build, release,
and run.
The main function of setup is to specify which add-ons are needed. These are hosted
solutions Heroku provides, typically for a fee. The big one is our database which
363 https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/deploying-with-docker
364 https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/build-docker-images-heroku-yml
365 https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/build-docker-images-heroku-yml#heroku-yml-overview
Chapter 18: Deployment
 346
will rely on the free heroku-postgresql366 tier. Heroku takes care of provisioning it,
security updates, and we can easily upgrade the database size and uptime as needed.
The build section is how we specify the Dockerfile should be, well, built. This relies
on our current Dockerfile in the root directory.
The release phase is used to run tasks before each new release is deployed. For
example, we can make sure collectstatic is run on every deploy automatically.
Finally there is the run phase where we specify which processes actually run the
application. Notably, the use of Gunicorn as the web server.
heroku.yml
setup:
addons:
- plan: heroku-postgresql
build:
docker:
web: Dockerfile
release:
image: web
command:
- python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
run:
web: gunicorn bookstore_project.wsgi
Make sure to add the new deployment updates to Git and commit them. In the next
section we’ll push all our local code to Heroku itself.
366 https://elements.heroku.com/addons/heroku-postgresql
Chapter 18: Deployment
Command Line
$ git status
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'ch18'
347
Heroku Deployment
Now create a new app on Heroku for our Bookstore project. If you type heroku create
then Heroku will assign a random name. Since names are global in Heroku, it’s unlikely
that common ones like “blog” or “webapp” will be available. The name can always be
changed later within Heroku to an available global namespace.
Command Line
$ heroku create
Creating app... done, � damp-dawn-44130
https://damp-dawn-44130.herokuapp.com/ |
https://git.heroku.com/damp-dawn-44130.git
In this case Heroku assigned my app the name damp-dawn-44130. If you refresh the
Heroku dashboard on the website you will now see the newly created app.
Heroku New App
Chapter 18: Deployment
Click on the new app, damp-dawn-44130 in my case, to open the “Overview” page.
348
Heroku Overview Page
Then click on the “Settings” option at the top as we want to set our production
environment variables within Heroku.
Chapter 18: Deployment
 349
Heroku App Settings
Click on “Reveal Config Vars”. Then add environment variables for ENVIRONMENT to
“production,” the SECRET_KEY, and DEBUG equal to “0” from the docker-compose-prod.yml
file.
Chapter 18: Deployment
 350
Heroku Config Vars
It’s also possible to add config variables from the command line to Heroku. Doing so
via the Dashboard is easier to see, which is why it is demonstrated either way. Both
approaches work.
Now set the stack367 to use our Docker containers, not Heroku’s default buildpack.
Include your app name here at the end of the command after heroku stack:set
container -a.
367 https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/stack
Chapter 18: Deployment
Command Line
$ heroku stack:set container -a damp-dawn-44130
Stack set. Next release on � damp-dawn-44130 will use container.
Run git push heroku master to create a new release on � damp-dawn-44130.
351
To confirm this change executed correctly, refresh the Heroku dashboard page and
note that under the “Info” section, for “Stack” it now features “container.” That’s what
we want.
Heroku Stack
Before pushing our code to Heroku specify the hosted PostgreSQL database we want.
In our case, the free hobby-dev tier works well; it can always be updated in the future.
Chapter 18: Deployment
Command Line
$ heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev -a damp-dawn-44130
Creating heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev on � damp-dawn-44130... free
Database has been created and is available
! This database is empty. If upgrading, you can transfer
! data from another database with pg:copy
Created postgresql-opaque-38157 as DATABASE_URL
Use heroku addons:docs heroku-postgresql to view documentation
352
The dj-database-url setting we set previously will automatically find and use this
DATABASE_URL for us.
We’re ready! Create a Heroku remote368 , which means a version of our code that will
live on a Heroku-hosted server. Make sure to include -a and the name of your app.
Then “push” the code to Heroku which will result in building our Docker image and
running the containers.
Command Line
$ heroku git:remote -a damp-dawn-44130
$ git push heroku master
The initial push might take a while to complete. You can see active progress by clicking
on the “Activity” tab on the Heroku dashboard.
Our Bookstore project should now be available online. Remember that while the code
mirrors our own local code, the production site has its own database that has no
information in it. To run commands on it add heroku run to standard commands. For
example, we should migrate our initial database and then create a superuser account.
368 https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git#creating-a-heroku-remote
Chapter 18: Deployment
Command Line
$ heroku run python manage.py migrate
$ heroku run python manage.py createsuperuser
353
There are two ways to open the newly-deployed application. From the command line
you can type heroku open -a and the name of your app. Or you can click on the “Open
app” button in the upper right corner of the Heroku dashboard.
Command Line
$ heroku open -a damp-dawn-44130
Heroku Redirects
But...ack! What’s this? A redirect error. Welcome to the joys of deployment where
issues like this will crop up all the time.
Chapter 18: Deployment
 354
SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER
Some sleuthing uncovers that the issue is related to our SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT369
setting. Heroku uses proxies and so we must find the proper header and update
SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER370 accordingly.
Since we do trust Heroku we can add Django’s default suggestion. So update the
“production” section of bookstore_project/settings.py with the following line.
Code
# bookstore_project/settings.py
# production
if ENVIRONMENT == 'production':
SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER = True
X_FRAME_OPTIONS = 'DENY'
SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True
SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS = 3600
SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS = True
SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD = True
SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF = True
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True
CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True
SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER = ('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO', 'https') # new
While we’re at it, we can also update ALLOWED_HOSTS with the exact URL name of
our Heroku deployment. Mine is damp-dawn-44130.herokuapp.com/ so the updated
configuration looks as follows:
369 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/settings/#secure-ssl-redirect
370 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/settings/#std:setting-SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER
Chapter 18: Deployment
 355
Code
# bookstore_project/settings.py
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['damp-dawn-44130.herokuapp.com', 'localhost', '127.0.0.1']
Use your own unique Heroku subdomain here!
Finally, commit these changes to Git and then push the updated code to Heroku.
Command Line
$ git status
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'secure_proxy_ssl_header and allowed_hosts update'
$ git push heroku master
After the build has completed refresh the webpage for your site. There it is!
Heroku Live Site
Heroku Logs
It is inevitable that you will have errors in your deployment at some point. When you
do, run heroku logs --tail to see error and info logs and debug what’s going on.
Chapter 18: Deployment
 356
Hopefully this deployment process was smooth. But in practice, even with an estab-
lished Platform-as-a-Service like Heroku, it is highly likely that issues will occur. If
you see an error page, type heroku logs --tail, which displays info and error logs, to
diagnose the issue.
Stripe Live Payments
Our orders page is still running with Stripe in test mode. How do we update this
to use live keys and make actual payments? First, make sure to fully activate your
account on the Stripe website by filling in additional personal and banking infor-
mation about yourself. Second, add the live publishable and secret keys to your
docker-compose-prod.yml file–docker-compose.yml is for local development only.
docker-compose-prod.yml
version: '3.7'
services:
web:
build: .
command: gunicorn bookstore_project.wsgi -b 0.0.0.0:8000
environment:
- ENVIRONMENT=production
- SECRET_KEY=p_o3vp1rg5)t^lxm9-43%0)s-=1qpeq%o7gfq+e4#*!t+_ev82
- DEBUG=0
- STRIPE_LIVE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<pk_live_your_publishable_key_here>
- STRIPE_LIVE_SECRET_KEY=<sk_live_your_secret_key_here>
ports:
- 8000:8000
depends_on:
Chapter 18: Deployment
- db
db:
image: postgres:11
357
And third, add these two new environment variables to bookstore_project/settings.py
under the existing entries for Stripe test values.
Code
# bookstore_project/settings.py
STRIPE_LIVE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=os.environ.get('STRIPE_LIVE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY')
STRIPE_LIVE_SECRET_KEY=os.environ.get('STRIPE_LIVE_SECRET_KEY')
To confirm these production settings work as expected make sure to stop any running
local Docker containers, then restart with docker-compose-prod.yml and try it out.
Command Line
$ docker-compose down
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-prod.yml up -d --build
Be aware that this is a real payment! While it is going to your own banking account
Stripe will still deduct its standard 2.9% + 30 cents per transaction so test this
sparingly.
Heroku Add-ons
Heroku comes with a large list of add-on services371 that, for a fee, can be quickly
added to any site. For example, to enable caching with Memcache, Memcachier372 is
an option to consider.
371 https://elements.heroku.com/addons/
372 https://elements.heroku.com/addons/memcachier
Chapter 18: Deployment
 358
Daily backups373 are an additional, but essential, feature of any production database.
And if you’re using a custom domain for your site, ensuring SSL is vital for any website,
especially one handling payments. You will need to be on a paid tier on Heroku374 to
enable this functionality.

Conclusion
Even with all the advantages of a modern Platform-as-a-Service like Heroku, de-
ployment remains a complicated and often frustrating task for many developers.
Personally, I want my web apps to “just work”. But many engineers come to enjoy the
challenges of working on performance, security, and scaling. After all, it is far easier to
measure improvements in this realm: did page load times decrease? Did site uptime
improve? Is security up-to-date? Working on these problems can often feel far more
rewarding than debating which new feature to add to the site itself.
