Chapter 10: Books App
In this chapter we will build a Books app for our project that displays all available
books and has an individual page for each. We’ll also explore different URL approaches
starting with using an id, then switching to a slug, and finally using a UUID.
To start we must create this new app which we’ll call books.
Command Line
$ docker-compose exec web python manage.py startapp books
And to ensure Django knows about our new app, open your text editor and add the
new app to INSTALLED_APPS in our settings.py file:
Code

# bookstore_project/settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
'django.contrib.admin',
'django.contrib.auth',
'django.contrib.contenttypes',
'django.contrib.sessions',
'django.contrib.messages',
'django.contrib.staticfiles',
'django.contrib.sites',
# Third-party
'allauth',
'allauth.account',
Chapter 10: Books App
'crispy_forms',
# Local
'users.apps.UsersConfig',
'pages.apps.PagesConfig',
'books.apps.BooksConfig', # new
]
Ok, initial creation complete!
189
Models
Ultimately we’ll need a model, view, url, and template for each page so it’s common
to debate where start. The model is a good place to start as it sets the structure. Let’s
think about what fields we might want to include. To keep things simple we’ll start
with a title, author, and price.
Update the books/models.py file to include our new Books model.
Code
# books/models.py
from django.db import models
class Book(models.Model):
title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
author = models.CharField(max_length=200)
price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=6, decimal_places=2)
Chapter 10: Books App
 190
def __str__(self):
return self.title
At the top we’re importing the Django class models and then creating a Book model
that subclasses it which means we automatically have access to everything within
django.db.models.Models177 and can add additional fields and methods as desired.
For title and author we’re limiting the length to 200 characters and for price using
a DecimalField178 which is a good choice when dealing with currency.
Below we’ve specified a __str__ method to control how the object is outputted in the
Admin and Django shell.
Now that our new database model is created we need to create a new migration record
for it.
Command Line
$ docker-compose exec web python manage.py makemigrations books
Migrations for 'books':
books/migrations/0001_initial.py
- Create model Book
And then apply the migration to our database.
Command Line
$ docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate books
Adding the name of the app books to each command is optional but a good habit as it
keeps both the migrations file and the migrate command focused on just that app. If
we’d left the app name off then all changes would be included in the migrations file
and database migrate which can be harder to debug later on.
177 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/db/models/
178 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/models/fields/#decimalfield
Chapter 10: Books App
Our database is configured. Let’s add some data to the admin.
191
Admin
We need a way to access our data for which the Django admin is perfectly suited.
Don’t forget to update the books/admin.py file or else the app won’t appear! I forget
this step almost every time even after using Django for years.
Code
# books/admin.py
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Book
admin.site.register(Book)
If you look into the admin at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/179 the Books app is now
there.
179 http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
Chapter 10: Books App
 192
Admin Homepage
Let’s add a book entry for Django for Professionals. Click on the + Add button next
to Books to create a new entry. The title is “Django for Professionals”, the author is
“William S. Vincent”, and the price is $39.00. There’s no need to include the dollar
sign $ in the amount as we’ll add that in our eventual template.
Chapter 10: Books App
 193
Admin - Django for Professionals book
After clicking on the “Save” button we’re redirected to the main Books page which
only shows the title.
Admin Books Page
Let’s update the books/admin.py file to specify which fields we also want displayed.
Chapter 10: Books App
Code
# books/admin.py
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Book
class BookAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
list_display = ("title", "author", "price",)
admin.site.register(Book, BookAdmin)
Then refresh the page.
194
Admin Books List Page
Now that our database model is complete we need to create the necessary views,
URLs, and templates so we can display the information on our web application. Where
to start is always a question and a confusing one at that for developers.
Personally I often start with the URLs, then the Views, and the Templates.
Chapter 10: Books App
 195
URLs
We need to update two urls.py files. The first is bookstore_project/urls.py to notify
it of the proper path for our new books app.
Code
# bookstore_project/urls.py
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include
urlpatterns = [
# Django admin
path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
# User management
path('accounts/', include('allauth.urls')),
# Local apps
path('', include('pages.urls')),
path('books/', include('books.urls')), # new
]
Now create our books app URLs paths. We must create this file first.
Command Line
$ touch books/urls.py
We’ll use empty string '' so combined with the fact that all books app URLs will start
at books/ that will also be the route for our main list view of each book. The view it
references, BookListView, has yet to be created.
Chapter 10: Books App
Code
# books/urls.py
from django.urls import path
from .views import BookListView
urlpatterns = [
path('', BookListView.as_view(), name='book_list'),
]
196
Views
Moving on time for that BookListView we just referenced in our URLs file. This will
rely on the built-in ListView180, a Generic Class-Based View provided for common
use cases like this. All we must do is specify the proper model and template to be
used.
180 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/class-based-views/generic-display/#django.views.generic.list.
ListView
Chapter 10: Books App
Code
# books/views.py
from django.views.generic import ListView
from .models import Book
197
class BookListView(ListView):
model = Book
template_name = 'books/book_list.html'
Note the template book_list.html does not exist yet.
Templates
It is optional to create an app specific folder within templates but it can help especially
as number grows in size so we’ll create one called books.
Command Line
$ mkdir templates/books/
$ touch templates/books/book_list.html
Chapter 10: Books App
Code
<!-- templates/books/book_list.html -->
{% extends '_base.html' %}
{% block title %}Books{% endblock title %}
198
{% block content %}
{% for book in object_list %}
<div>
<h2><a href="">{{ book.title }}</a></h2>
</div>
{% endfor %}
{% endblock content %}
At the top we note that this template extends _base.html and then wraps our desired
code with content blocks. We use the Django Templating Language to set up a simple
for loop for each book. Note that object_list comes from ListView and contains all
the objects in our view.
The final step is to spin up and then down our containers to reload the Django
settings.py file. Otherwise it won’t realize we’ve made a change and so there will
be an error page and in the logs a message about “ModuleNotFoundError: No module
named ‘books.urls’”.
Spin down and then up again our containers.
Chapter 10: Books App
Command Line
$ docker-compose down
$ docker-compose up -d
If you go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/books/181 now the books page will work.
199
Books Page
object_list
ListView relies on object_list, as we just saw, but this is far from descriptive. A better
approach is to rename it to a friendlier182 name using context_object_name.
Update books/views.py as follows.
181 http://127.0.0.1:8000/books/
182 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/class-based-views/generic-display/#making-friendly-
template-contexts
Chapter 10: Books App
Code
# books/views.py
from django.views.generic import ListView, DetailView
from .models import Book
200
class BookListView(ListView):
model = Book
context_object_name = 'book_list' # new
template_name = 'books/book_list.html'
And then swap out object_list in our template for book_list.
Code
<!-- templates/books/book_list.html -->
{% extends '_base.html' %}
{% block title %}Books{% endblock title %}
{% block content %}
{% for book in book_list %}
<div>
<h2><a href="">{{ object.title }}</a></h2>
</div>
{% endfor %}
{% endblock content %}
Refresh the page and it will still work as before! This technique is especially helpful
Chapter 10: Books App
 201
on larger projects where multiple developers are working on a project. It’s hard for a
front-end engineer to guess correctly what object_list means!
To prove the list view works for multiple items add two more books to the site via the
admin. I’ve added my two other Django books–Django for Beginners and Django for
APIs–which both have “William S. Vincent” as the author and “39.00” as the price.
Three Books
Individual Book Page
Now we can add individual pages for each book by using another Generic Class-Based
View called DetailView183 .
Our process is similar to the Books page and starts with the URL importing BookDetailView
on the second line and then setting the path to be the primary key of each book which
will be represented as an integer <int:pk>.
183 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/class-based-views/generic-display/#detailview
Chapter 10: Books App
Code
# books/urls.py
from django.urls import path
from .views import BookListView, BookDetailView # new
202
urlpatterns = [
path('', BookListView.as_view(), name='book_list'),
path('<int:pk>', BookDetailView.as_view(), name='book_detail'), # new
]
Django automatically adds an auto-incrementing primary key184 to our database
models. So while we only declared the fields title, author, and body on our Book model,
under-the-hood Django also added another field called id, which is our primary key.
We can access it as either id or pk.
The pk for our first book is 1. For the second one it will 2. And so on. Therefore when
we go to the individual entry page for our first book, we can expect that its URL route
will be books/1.
Now on to the books/views.py file where we’ll import DetailView and create a
BookDetailView class that also specifies model and template_name fields.
184 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/db/models/#automatic-primary-key-fields
Chapter 10: Books App
Code
# books/views.py
from django.views.generic import ListView, DetailView # new
from .models import Book
203
class BookListView(ListView):
model = Book
context_object_name = 'book_list'
template_name = 'books/book_list.html'
class BookDetailView(DetailView): # new
model = Book
template_name = 'books/book_detail.html'
And finally the template which we must first create.
Command Line
$ touch templates/books/book_detail.html
Then have it display all the current fields. We can also showcase the title in the title
tags so that it appears in the web browser tab.
Chapter 10: Books App
 204
Code
<!-- templates/books/book_detail.html -->
{% extends '_base.html' %}
{% block title %}{{ object.title }}{% endblock title %}
{% block content %}
<div class="book-detail">
<h2><a href="">{{ object.title }}</a></h2>
<p>Author: {{ object.author }}</p>
<p>Price: {{ object.price }}</p>
</div>
{% endblock content %}
If you navigate now to http://127.0.0.1:8000/books/1/185 you’ll see a dedicated page
for our first book.
185 http://127.0.0.1:8000/books/1/
Book Detail Page
Chapter 10: Books App
 205
context_object_name
Just as ListView defaults to object_list which we updated to be more specific, so too
DetailView defaults to object which we can make more descriptive using context_-
object_name. We’ll set it to book.
Code
# books/views.py
...
class BookDetailView(DetailView):
model = Book
context_object_name = 'book' # new
template_name = 'books/book_detail.html'
Don’t forget to update our template too with this change, swapping out object for
book for our three fields.
Code
<!-- templates/books/book_detail.html -->
{% extends '_base.html' %}
{% block title %}{{ book.title }}{% endblock title %}
{% block content %}
<div class="book-detail">
<h2><a href="">{{ book.title }}</a></h2>
<p>Author: {{ book.author }}</p>
<p>Price: {{ book.price }}</p>
</div>
{% endblock content %}
Chapter 10: Books App
 206
As a final step update the URL link on the book list page to point to individual page.
With the url template tag186 we can point to book_detail – the URL name set in
books/urls.py – and then pass in the pk.
Code
<!-- templates/books/book_list.html -->
{% extends '_base.html' %}
{% block title %}Books{% endblock title %}
{% block content %}
{% for book in book_list %}
<div>
<h2><a href="{% url 'book_detail' book.pk %}">{{ book.title }}</a></h2>
</div>
{% endfor %}
{% endblock content %}
Refresh the book list page at http://127.0.0.1:8000/books/187 and links are now all
clickable and direct to the correct individual book page.
get_absolute_url
One additional step we haven’t made yet, but should is to add a get_absolute_url()188
method which sets a canonical URL for the model. It is also required when using the
186 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/templates/builtins/#url
187 http://127.0.0.1:8000/books/
188 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/models/instances/#get-absolute-url
Chapter 10: Books App
 207
reverse()189 function which is commonly used.
Here’s how to add it to our books/models.py file. Import reverse at the top. Then add
the get_absolute_url method which will be the reverse of our URL name, book_detail,
and passes in the id as a string.
Code
# books/models.py
from django.db import models
from django.urls import reverse # new
class Book(models.Model):
title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
author = models.CharField(max_length=200)
price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=6, decimal_places=2)
def__str__(self):
return self.title
def get_absolute_url(self): # new
return reverse('book_detail', args=[str(self.id)])
Then we can update the templates. Currently our a href link is using {% url 'book_-
detail' book.pk %}. However we can instead use get_absolute_url directly which
already has the pk passed in.
189 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/urlresolvers/#django.urls.reverse
Chapter 10: Books App
Code
<!-- templates/books/book_list.html -->
{% extends '_base.html' %}
{% block title %}Books{% endblock title %}
208
{% block content %}
{% for book in book_list %}
<div>
<h2><a href="{{ book.get_absolute_url }}">{{ book.title }}</a></h2>
</div>
{% endfor %}
{% endblock content %}
There’s no need to use the url template tag either, just one canonical reference that
can be changed, if needed, in the books/models.py file and will propagate throughout
the project from there. This is a cleaner approach and should be used whenever you
need individual pages for an object.
Primary Keys vs. IDs
It can be confusing whether to use a primary key (PK) or an ID in a project, especially
since Django’s DetailView treats them interchangeably. However there is a subtle
difference.
The id is a model field automatically set by Django internally to auto-increment. So
the first book has an id of 1, the second entry of 2, and so on. This is also, by default,
treated as the primary key pk of a model.
Chapter 10: Books App
 209
However it’s possible to manually change what the primary key is for a model. It
doesn’t have to be id, but could be something like object_id depending on the use
case. Additionally Python has a built-in id()190 object which can sometimes cause
confusion and/or bugs.
By contrast the primary key pk refers to the primary key field of a model so you’re
safer using pk when in doubt. And in fact in the next section we will update the id of
our model!
Slugs vs. UUIDs
Using the pk field in the URL of our DetailView is quick and easy, but not ideal for a
real-world project. The pk is currently the same as our auto-incrementing id. Among
other concerns, it tells a potential hacker exactly how many records you have in your
database; it tells them exactly what the id is which can be used in a potential attack;
and there can be synchronization issues if you have multiple front-ends.
There are two alternative approaches. The first is called a “slug,” a newspaper term
for a short label for something that is often used in URLs. For example, in our example
of “Django for Professionals” its slug could be django-for-professionals. There’s even
a SlugField191 model field that can be used and either added when creating the title
field by hand or auto-populated upon save. The main challenge with slugs is handling
duplicates, though this can be solved by adding random strings or numbers to a given
slug field. The synchronization issue remains though.
A better approach is to use a UUID (Universally Unique IDentifier)192 which Django
now supports via a dedicated UUIDField193 .
190 https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/functions.html#id
191 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/models/fields/#slugfield
192 https://docs.python.org/3/library/uuid.html?highlight=uuid#module-uuid
193 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.UUIDField
Chapter 10: Books App
 210
Let’s implement a UUID now by adding a new field to our model and then updating
the URL path.
Import uuid at the top and then update the id field to actually be a UUIDField that
is now the primary key. We also use uuid4 for the encryption. This allows us to use
DetailView which requires either a slug or pk field; it won’t work with a UUID field
without significant modification.
Code
# books/models.py
import uuid # new
from django.db import models
from django.urls import reverse
class Book(models.Model):
id = models.UUIDField( # new
primary_key=True,
default=uuid.uuid4,
editable=False)
title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
author = models.CharField(max_length=200)
price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=6, decimal_places=2)
def__str__(self):
return self.title
def get_absolute_url(self):
return reverse('book_detail', args=[str(self.id)])
Chapter 10: Books App
In the URL path swap out int for uuid in the detail view.
Code
# books/urls.py
from django.urls import path
from .views import BookListView, BookDetailView
211
urlpatterns = [
path('', BookListView.as_view(), name='book_list'),
path('<uuid:pk>', BookDetailView.as_view(), name='book_detail'), # new
]
But now we are faced with a problem: there are existing book entries, three in fact,
with their own ids as well as related migration files that use them. Creating a new
migration like this causes real problems194 . The simplest approach, which we will use,
is the most destructive: to simply delete old books migrations and start over.
Command Line
$ docker-compose exec web rm -r books/migrations
$ docker-compose down
One last issue is that we are also persisting our PostgreSQL database via a volume
mount that still has records to the older id fields. You can see this with the docker
volume ls command.
194 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/howto/writing-migrations/#migrations-that-add-unique-fields
Chapter 10: Books App
Command Line
$ docker volume ls
DRIVER
local
VOLUME NAME
books_postgres_data
212
The simplest approach is again to simply delete the volume and start over with Docker.
As we’re early enough in the project we’ll take this route; a more mature project would
require considering a more complex approach.
The steps involve starting up our web and db containers; adding a new initial migration
file for the books app, applying all updates with migrate, and then creating a superuser
account again.
Command Line
$ docker volume rm books_postgres_data
$ docker-compose up -d
$ docker-compose exec web python manage.py makemigrations books
$ docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
$ docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
Now go into admin and add the three books again. If you then navigate to the main
books page and click on an individual book you’ll be taken to a new detail page with a
UUID in the URL.
Chapter 10: Books App
 213
Django for Professionals book UUID
Navbar
Let’s add a link to the books page in our navbar. We can use the url template tag and
the URL name of the page which is book_list.
Code
<!-- templates/_base.html -->
<nav class="my-2 my-md-0 mr-md-3">
<a class="p-2 text-dark" href="{% url 'book_list' %}">Books</a>
<a class="p-2 text-dark" href="{% url 'about' %}">About</a>
Updated NavBar
Chapter 10: Books App
 214
Tests
We need to test our model and views now. We want to ensure that the Books model
works as expected, including its str representation. And we want to test both ListView
and DetailView.
Here’s what sample tests look like in the books/tests.py file.
Code
# books/tests.py
from django.test import Client, TestCase
from django.urls import reverse
from .models import Book
class BookTests(TestCase):
def setUp(self):
self.book = Book.objects.create(
title='Harry Potter',
author='JK Rowling',
price='25.00',
)
def test_book_listing(self):
self.assertEqual(f'{self.book.title}', 'Harry Potter')
self.assertEqual(f'{self.book.author}', 'JK Rowling')
self.assertEqual(f'{self.book.price}', '25.00')
Chapter 10: Books App
def test_book_list_view(self):
response = self.client.get(reverse('book_list'))
self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
self.assertContains(response, 'Harry Potter')
self.assertTemplateUsed(response, 'books/book_list.html')
215
def test_book_detail_view(self):
response = self.client.get(self.book.get_absolute_url())
no_response = self.client.get('/books/12345/')
self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
self.assertEqual(no_response.status_code, 404)
self.assertContains(response, 'Harry Potter')
self.assertTemplateUsed(response, 'books/book_detail.html')
We import TestCase which we’ve seen before and also Client()195 which is new and
used as a dummy Web browser for simulating GET and POST requests on a URL. In
other words, whenever you’re testing views you should use Client().
In our setUp method we add a sample book to test. test_book_listing checks that both
its string representation and content are correct. Then we use test_book_list_view to
confirm that our homepage returns a 200 HTTP status code, contains our body text,
and uses the correct books/book_list.html template. Finally, test_book_detail_view
tests that our detail page works as expected and that an incorrect page returns a 404.
It’s always good both to test that something does exist and that something incorrect
doesn’t exist in your tests.
Go ahead and run these tests now. They should all pass.

Conclusion
We’re at the end of quite a long chapter, but the architecture of our Bookstore project
is now much clearer. We’ve added a books model, learned how to change the URL
structure, and switched to the much more secure UUID pattern.
