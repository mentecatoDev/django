Chapter 7: Advanced User Registration
At this point we have the standard Django user registration implemented. But often
that’s just the starting point on professional projects. What about customizing things
a bit? For example, Django’s default username/email/password pattern is somewhat
dated these days. It’s far more common to simply require email/password for sign up
and log in. And really every part of the authentication flow–the forms, emails, pages–
can be customized if so desired.
Another major factor in many projects is the need for social authentication, that is
handling sign up and log in via a third-party service like Google, Facebook, and so on.
We could implement our own solutions here from scratch but there are some definite
risks: user registration is a complex area with many moving parts and one area where
we really do not want to make a security mistake.
For this reason, many professional Django developers rely on the popular third-
party django-allauth133 . Adding any third party package should come with a degree
of caution since you are adding another dependency to your technical stack. It’s
important to make sure any package is both up-to-date and well tested. Fortunately
django-allauth is both.
At the cost of a little bit of magic it addresses all of these concerns and makes
customization much, much easier.

django-allauth
Start by installing django-allauth. Because we’re using Pipenv we want to avoid
conflicts with the Pipfile.lock so we’ll install it within Docker first, then stop Docker,
and rebuild our image with the --build flag which prevents the default image caching
and ensures that our entire image is built from scratch.
Command Line
$ docker-compose exec web pipenv install django-allauth==0.40.0
$ docker-compose down
$ docker-compose up -d --build
Our website will still function the same as before since we haven’t explicitly told
Django about this new django-allauth package. To do that we need to update the
INSTALLED_APPS config within our settings.py file adding Django’s built-in, but op-
tional, sites framework134 , as well as allauth and its account feature allauth.account.
Django’s sites framework is a powerful feature that allows one Django project to
control multiple sites. Given we only have one site in our project, we’ll set the SITE_ID
to 1. If we added a second site it would have an ID of 2, a third site would have an ID
of 3, and so on.
134 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/contrib/sites/
Chapter 7: Advanced User Registration
Code
# bookstore_project/settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
'django.contrib.admin',
'django.contrib.auth',
'django.contrib.contenttypes',
'django.contrib.sessions',
'django.contrib.messages',
'django.contrib.staticfiles',
'django.contrib.sites', # new
# Third-party
'crispy_forms',
'allauth', # new
'allauth.account', # new
]
# Local
'users.apps.UsersConfig',
'pages.apps.PagesConfig',
# django-allauth config
SITE_ID = 1 # new
139
AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS
The settings.py file created by Django for any new project contains a number of
explicit settings–those that we see in the file already–as well as a longer additional
Chapter 7: Advanced User Registration
 140
list of implicit settings that exist but aren’t visible. This can be confusing at first. The
complete list of settings configurations is available here135 .
An example is the AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS136 setting. Under the hood Django
sets this to 'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend' which is used when Django
attempts to authenticate a user.
We could add the following line to settings.py and the current behavior would remain
unchanged:
Code
AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
)
However for django-allauth we need to add its specific authentication options, too,
which will allow us to switch over to using login via e-mail in a moment. So at the
bottom of your settings.py file add the following section:
Code
# bookstore_project/settings.py
# django-allauth config
SITE_ID = 1
AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
'allauth.account.auth_backends.AuthenticationBackend', # new
)
135 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/settings/
136 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/settings/#authentication-backends
Chapter 7: Advanced User Registration
 141
EMAIL_BACKEND
Another configuration implicitly set is EMAIL_BACKEND137 . By default Django will
look for a configured SMTP server138 to send emails.
django-allauth will send such an email upon a successful user registration, which
we can and will customize later, but since we don’t yet have a SMTP server properly
configured, it will result in an error.
The solution, for now, is to have Django output any emails to the command line
console instead. Thus we can override the default, implicit config by using console139
instead of smtp. Add this at the bottom of the settings.py file.
Code
# bookstore_project/settings.py
# django-allauth config
SITE_ID = 1
AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
'allauth.account.auth_backends.AuthenticationBackend',
)
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend' # new
137 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/settings/#email-backend
138 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol
139 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/email/#console-backend
Chapter 7: Advanced User Registration
 142
ACCOUNT_LOGOUT_REDIRECT
There’s one more subtle change to make to our configurations at this time. If you look
at the configurations page140 again you’ll see there is a setting for ACCOUNT_LOGOUT_-
REDIRECT that defaults to the path of the homepage at /.
In our current settings.py file we have the following two lines for redirects which
point to the homepage via its URL name of 'home'.
Code
# bookstore_project/settings.py
LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = 'home'
LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL = 'home'
The issue is that django-allauth’s ACCOUNT_LOGOUT_REDIRECT actually overrides the
built-in LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL, however, since they both point to the homepage this
change may not be apparent. To future-proof our application since maybe we don’t
want to always redirect to the homepage on logout, we should be explicit here with
the logout redirect.
We can also move the two redirect lines under our django-allauth config section.
This is what the entire django-allauth config section should look like at this time.
140 https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html
Chapter 7: Advanced User Registration
Code
# bookstore_project/settings.py
# django-allauth config
LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = 'home'
ACCOUNT_LOGOUT_REDIRECT = 'home' # new
SITE_ID = 1
AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
'allauth.account.auth_backends.AuthenticationBackend',
)
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'
Given that we have made many changes to our bookstore_project/settings.pylet’s now run migrate to update our database.
Command Line
$ docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
Operations to perform:
Apply all migrations: account, admin, auth, contenttypes, sess
ions, sites, users

file
Chapter 7: Advanced User Registration
 144
URLs
We also need to swap out the built-in auth app URLs for django-allauth’s own allauth
app. We’ll still use the same accounts/ URL path, however, since we’ll be using django
allauth’s templates and routes for sign up we can delete the URL path for our users
app, too.
Code
# bookstore_project/urls.py
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include
urlpatterns = [
# Django admin
path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
# User management
path('accounts/', include('allauth.urls')), # new
# Local apps
path('', include('pages.urls')),
]
At this point we could further delete users/urls.py and users/views.py which were
both created solely for our hand-written sign up page and are no longer being used.
Chapter 7: Advanced User Registration
 145
Templates
Django’s auth app looks for templates within a templates/registration directory,
but django-allauth prefers they be located within a templates/account directory. So
we will create a new templates/account directory and then copy over our existing
login.html and signup.html templates into it.
Command Line
$ mkdir templates/account
$ mv templates/registration/login.html templates/account/login.html
$ mv templates/signup.html templates/account/signup.html
It’s easy to add an s onto account here by accident, but don’t or you’ll get an error. The
correct directory is templates/account/.
We can delete the templates/registration directory at this point since it is no longer
needed.
Command Line
$ rm -r templates/registration
rm means remove and r means do it recursively, which is necessary whenever you are
dealing with a directory. If you’d like further information on this command you can
type man rm to read the manual.
The last step is to update the URL links within both templates/_base.html and
templates/home.html to use django-allauth’s URL names rather than Django’s. We do
this by adding an account_ prefix so Django’s 'logout' will now be 'account_logout',
'login' will be 'account_login', and signup will be account_signup.
Chapter 7: Advanced User Registration
 146
Code
<!-- templates/_base.html -->
...
<nav class="my-2 my-md-0 mr-md-3">
<a class="p-2 text-dark" href="{% url 'about' %}">About</a>
{% if user.is_authenticated %}
<a class="p-2 text-dark" href="{% url 'account_logout' %}">Log Out</a>
{% else %}
<a class="p-2 text-dark" href="{% url 'account_login' %}">Log In</a>
<a class="btn btn-outline-primary"
href="{% url 'account_signup' %}">Sign Up</a>
{% endif %}
</nav>
...
Code
<!-- templates/home.html -->
{% extends '_base.html' %}
{% load static %}
{% block title %}Home{% endblock title %}
{% block content %}
<h1>Homepage</h1>
<img class="bookcover" src="{% static 'images/djangoforprofessionals.jpg' %}">
{% if user.is_authenticated %}
<p>Hi {{ user.email }}!</p>
<p><a href="{% url 'account_logout' %}">Log Out</a></p>
{% else %}
Chapter 7: Advanced User Registration
 147
<p>You are not logged in</p>
<p><a href="{% url 'account_login' %}">Log In</a> |
<a href="{% url 'account_signup' %}">Sign Up</a></p>
{% endif %}
{% endblock content %}
And we’re done!
Log In
If you refresh the homepage at http://127.0.0.1:8000141 and then click on the “Log in”
link you’ll see an updated page.
Log In Page
Note the new “Remember Me” box option. This is the first of many configurations142
that django-allauth provides. The default None asks the user if they want their session
141 http://127.0.0.1:8000
142 https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html
Chapter 7: Advanced User Registration
 148
to be remembered so they don’t have to log in again. It can also be set to False to not
remember or True to always remember. We’ll choose True which is how a traditional
Django log in page would work.
Under our # django-allauth config section of the bookstore_project/settings.py file
add a new line for this.
Code
# bookstore_project/settings.py
# django-allauth config
...
ACCOUNT_SESSION_REMEMBER = True # new
Refresh the “Log In” page and the box is gone!
Log In Page No Box
If you try out the log in form with your superuser account it will redirect back to the
homepage with a welcome message. Click on the “Log Out” link.
Chapter 7: Advanced User Registration
 149
Log Out Page
Rather than directly log us out django-allauth has an intermediary “Log Out” page
which we can customize to match the rest of our project.
Log Out
Update the default Log Out template by creating a templates/account/logout.html file
to override it.
Command Line
$ touch templates/account/logout.html
Like our other templates it will extend _base.html and include Bootstrap styling on
the submitted button.
Chapter 7: Advanced User Registration
Code
<!-- templates/account/logout.html -->
{% extends '_base.html' %}
{% load crispy_forms_tags %}
{% block title %}Log Out{% endblock %}
{% block content %}
<div class="container">
<h1>Log Out</h1>
<p>Are you sure you want to log out?</p>
<form method="post" action="{% url 'account_logout' %}">
{% csrf_token %}
{{ form|crispy }}
<button class="btn btn-danger" type="submit">Log Out</button>
</form>
</div>
{% endblock content %}
Go ahead and refresh the page.
150
Chapter 7: Advanced User Registration
 151
Custom Log Out Page
Sign Up
At the top of our website, in the nav bar, click on link for “Sign Up” which has Bootstrap
and django-crispy-forms styling.
Chapter 7: Advanced User Registration
 152
Sign Up Page
An optional customization we can make via django-allauth is to only ask for a
password once. Since we’ll configure password change and reset options later, there’s
less of a risk that a user who types in the password incorrectly will be locked out of
their account.
This change is, if you look at the django-allauth configuration options143 , is a one-liner.
143 https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html
Chapter 7: Advanced User Registration
Code
# bookstore_project/settings.py
# django-allauth config
...
ACCOUNT_SIGNUP_PASSWORD_ENTER_TWICE = False # new
153
Refresh the page and the form will update itself to remove the additional password
line.
Sign Up with Single Password
Now create a new user to confirm everything works. We can call the user testuser1,
use testuser1@email.com as email, and testpass123 as the password.
Upon submit it will redirect you to the homepage.
Chapter 7: Advanced User Registration
 154
testuser Homepage
Remember how we configured email to output to the console? django-allauth auto-
matically sends an email upon registration which we can view by typing docker-compose
logs.
Command Line
$ docker-compose logs

There it is. Later on we’ll customize this message and configure a proper email service
to send it to actual users.
Admin
Log in to the admin with your superuser account at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/144
and we can see it, too, has changed now that django-allauth is involved.

Admin Homepage
There are two new sections: Accounts and Sites courtesy of our recent work. If you
click on the Users section we see our traditional view that shows the three current
user accounts.

Go back to the homepage and click on the section for Sites to see what the Django
sites framework provides. We’ll update both the Domain Name and the Display Name
in a later chapter on configuring email.
Chapter 7: Advanced User Registration
 158
Admin Sites
Email Only Login
It’s time to really use django-allauth’s extensive list of configurations145 by switching
over to using just email for login, not username. This requires a few changes. First we’ll
make a username not required, but set email instead to required. Then we’ll require
email to be unique and the authentication method of choice.
145 https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html
Chapter 7: Advanced User Registration
Code
# bookstore_project/settings.py
# django-allauth config
...
ACCOUNT_USERNAME_REQUIRED = False # new
ACCOUNT_AUTHENTICATION_METHOD = 'email' # new
ACCOUNT_EMAIL_REQUIRED = True # new
ACCOUNT_UNIQUE_EMAIL = True # new
159
Navigate back to the homepage and click on “Log Out” since you’ll be logged in with
your superuser account. Then click on the navbar link for “Sign Up” and create an
account for testuser2@email.com with testpass123 as the password.
Sign Up Email Only
After being redirected to the homepage upon success, now go into the admin at
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/146 to inspect what actually happened. Log in with your
superuser account and navigate to the Users section.
146 http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
Chapter 7: Advanced User Registration
 160
Admin Users
We can see that django-allauth automatically populated a username for us based on
the email part before the @. This is because our underlying CustomUser model still has
a username field. We didn’t delete it.
While this approach may seem a little hackish, but in fact it works just fine. Fully
removing the username from the custom user model requires the use of Abstract-
BaseUser147 , which is an additional, optional step some developers take. It requires
far more coding and understanding so it is not recommended unless you really know
your way around Django’s authentication system!
There is, however, an edge case here that we should confirm which is: what happens if
we have testuser2@email.com and then a sign up for testuser2@example.com? Wouldn’t
that result in a username of testuser2 for both which would cause a conflict? Let’s
147 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/auth/customizing/#django.contrib.auth.models.
AbstractBaseUser
Chapter 7: Advanced User Registration
 161
try it out!
Log out of the admin, go to the Sign Up Page again and create an account for
testuser2@example.com.
Sign Up Form
Now log back into the admin and go to our Users section.
Chapter 7: Advanced User Registration
 162
Admin Users
django-allauth automtically adds a two-digit string to the username. In this case
it is 49 so testuser2 becomes testuser249. This two-digit string will be randomly
generated for us.
Tests
Time for tests. Like any good third-party package django-allauth comes with its own
tests so we don’t need to re-test its core functionality, just confirm that our project
works as expected.
If you run our current test suite there are 3 errors related to SignupPageTests since
we’re using django-allauth now for this rather than our own views, forms, and urls.
Chapter 7: Advanced User Registration
Command Line
$ docker-compose exec web python manage.py test
...
Ran 15 tests in 0.363s
163
FAILED (errors=3)
Let’s update the tests. The first issue is that signup is no longer the correct URL name,
instead we’re using account_signup which is the name django-allauth provides. How
did I know that? I looked at the source code148 and found the URL name.
Another change is the location of the signup.html template which is now located at
account/signup.html.
We’re also not using CustomUserCreationForm anymore, but instead, that provided
by django-allauth so we can remove that test. Remove as well the imports for
CustomUserCreationForm and SignupPageView at the top of the file.
Code
# users/tests.py
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
from django.test import TestCase
from django.urls import reverse, resolve
class CustomUserTests(TestCase):

We now have a user registration flow that works and can be quickly extended into
social authentication if needed. In the next chapter we’ll add environment variables
to our project for greater security and flexibility.
