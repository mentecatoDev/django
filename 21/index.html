                <p>Chapter 5: User Registration
User registration is a core feature in any dynamic website. And it will be in our
Bookstore project, too. In this chapter we will implement log in, log out, and sign
up functionality. The first two are relatively straightforward since Django provides
us with the necessary views and urls for them, however sign up is more challenging
since there is no built-in solution.
Auth App
Let’s begin by implementing log in and log out using Django’s own auth78 app. Django
provides us with the necessary views and urls which means we only need to update
a template for things to work. This saves us a lot of time as developers and it ensures
that we don’t make a mistake since the underlying code has already been tested and
used by millions of developers.
However this simplicity comes at the cost of feeling “magical” to Django newcomers.
We covered some of these steps previously in my book, Django for Beginners79,
but we did not slow down and look at the underlying source code. The intention
for a beginner was to broadly explain and demonstrate “how” to implement user
registration properly, but this came at the cost of truly diving into “why” we used
the code we did.
Since this is a more advanced book, we delve deeper to understand the underlying
source code better. The approach here can also be used to explore any other built-in
Django functionality on your own.
78 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/auth/default/
79 https://djangoforbeginners.com
Chapter 5: User Registration
 87
The first thing we need to do is make sure the auth app is included in our INSTALLED_-
APPS setting. We have added our own apps here previously, but have you ever taken
a close look at the built-in apps Django adds automatically for us? Most likely the
answer is no. Let’s do that now!
Code</p>
<h1 id="bookstore_projectsettingspy">bookstore_project/settings.py</h1>
<p>INSTALLED_APPS = [
'django.contrib.admin',
'django.contrib.auth', # Yoohoo!!!!
'django.contrib.contenttypes',
'django.contrib.sessions',
'django.contrib.messages',
'django.contrib.staticfiles',
]</p>
<h1 id="local">Local</h1>
<p>'users.apps.UsersConfig',
'pages.apps.PagesConfig',
There are, in fact, 6 apps already there that Django provides for us which power the
site. The first is admin and the second is auth. This is how we know the auth app is
already present in our Django project.
When we earlier ran the migrate command for the first time all of these apps were
linked together in the initial database. And remember that we used the AUTH_USER_-
MODEL setting to tell Django to use our custom user model, not the default User model
here. This is why we had to wait until that configuration was complete before running
migrate for the first time.
Chapter 5: User Registration
 88
Auth URLs and Views
To use Django’s built-in auth app we must explicitly add it to our bookstore_-
project/urls.py file. The easiest approach is to use accounts/ as the prefix since that
is commonly used in the Django community. Make the one line change below. Note
that as our urls.py file grows in length, adding comments for each type of URL–admin,
user management, local apps, etc.–helps with readability.
Code</p>
<h1 id="bookstore_projecturlspy">bookstore_project/urls.py</h1>
<p>from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include
urlpatterns = [</p>
<h1 id="django-admin">Django admin</h1>
<p>path('admin/', admin.site.urls),</p>
<h1 id="user-management">User management</h1>
<p>path('accounts/', include('django.contrib.auth.urls')), # new</p>
<h1 id="local-apps">Local apps</h1>
<p>path('', include('pages.urls')),
]
What’s included in the auth app? A lot it turns out. First off, there are a number of
associated urls.
Chapter 5: User Registration
Code
accounts/login/ [name='login']
accounts/logout/ [name='logout']
accounts/password_change/ [name='password_change']
accounts/password_change/done/ [name='password_change_done']
accounts/password_reset/ [name='password_reset']
accounts/password_reset/done/ [name='password_reset_done']
accounts/reset/<uidb64>/<token>/ [name='password_reset_confirm']
accounts/reset/done/ [name='password_reset_complete']
89
How did I know that? Two ways. The first is the official auth docs80 tell us so! But a
second, deeper approach is to look at the Django source code which is available on
Github81 . If we navigate or search around we’ll find our way to the auth app itself82.
And within that we can find the urls.py file at this link83 which shows the complete
source code.
It takes practice to understand the Django source code, but it is well worth the time.
Homepage
What’s next? Let’s update our existing homepage so that it will notify us if a user is
already logged in or not which currently can only happen via the admin.
Here is the new code for the templates/home.html file. It uses the Django templating
engine’s if/else84 tags for basic logic.
80 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/auth/default/#module-django.contrib.auth.views
81 https://github.com/django/django
82 https://github.com/django/django/tree/b9cf764be62e77b4777b3a75ec256f6209a57671/django/contrib/auth
83 https://github.com/django/django/blob/b9cf764be62e77b4777b3a75ec256f6209a57671/django/contrib/auth/
urls.py
84 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/templates/builtins/#if
Chapter 5: User Registration
Code</p>
<!-- templates/home.html -->
<p>{% extends '_base.html' %}
{% block title %}Home{% endblock title %}
90
{% block content %}</p>
<h1>Homepage</h1>
<p>{% if user.is_authenticated %}
Hi {{ user.email }}!
{% else %}</p>
<p>You are not logged in</p>
<p><a href="{% url 'login' %}">Log In</a>
{% endif %}
{% endblock content %}
If the user is logged in (authenticated), we display a greeting that says “Hi” and
includes their email address. These are both variables85 which we can use with
Django’s template engine via double opening {{ and closing }} brackets.
The default User contains numerous fields including is_authenticated86 and email87
which are referenced here.
And the logout and login are URL names. The url88 template tag means if we specify
the URL name the link will automatically refer to that URL path. For example, in the
previous chapter we set the name of our homepage URL to home so a link to the
homepage would take the format of {% url 'home' %}. More on this shortly.

Chapter 5: User Registration
 91
If you look at the homepage now at http://127.0.0.1:8000/89 it will likely show the
email address of your superuser account since we used it previously to log in.
Homepage with greeting
In the admin over at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/90 if you click on the “Log out”
button in the upper right corner we can log out of the admin and by extension the
Django project.
Admin logout link
Return to the homepage at http://127.0.0.1:8000/91 and refresh the page.

Chapter 5: User Registration
 92
Django Source Code
You might have been able to piece together these steps on your own from reading
the official docs92 . But the deeper–and better–approach is to learn how to read the
Django source code on your own.
One question is, how was the user and its related variables magically available in our
template? The answer is that Django has a concept called the template context93
which means each template is loaded with data from the corresponding views.py file.
We can use user within template tags to access User attributes. In other words, Django
just gives this to us automatically.
So to check if a user is logged in or not, we access user and then can use the boolean
is_authenticated94 attribute. If a user is logged in, it will return True and we can do
things like display the user’s email. Or if no user is logged in, the result will be False.
Moving on we have the URL name login. Where did that come from? The answer, of
course, is from Django itself! Let’s unpack the code snippet {% url 'login' %} piece
by piece.
First up we’re using the url template tag95 which takes as its first argument a named
URL pattern96 . That’s the optional name section we add as a best practice to all our URL
paths. Therefore there must be a 'login' name attached to the URL used by Django
for log ins, right!
There are two ways we could have known this. In other words, if I hadn’t just told you
that we wanted to use {% url 'login' %}, how could you have figured it out?
First look at the official documentation97 . Personally I often use the search feature so
92 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/auth/default/
93 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/auth/default/#authentication-data-in-templates
94 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/contrib/auth/#django.contrib.auth.models.User.is_authenticated
95 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/templates/builtins/#url
96 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/http/urls/#naming-url-patterns
97 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/
Chapter 5: User Registration
 93
I would have typed in something like “login” and then clicked around until I found a
description of log in. The one we want is actually called authentication views98 and
lists the corresponding URL patterns for us.
Code
accounts/login/ [name='login']
accounts/logout/ [name='logout']
accounts/password_change/ [name='password_change']
accounts/password_change/done/ [name='password_change_done']
accounts/password_reset/ [name='password_reset']
accounts/password_reset/done/ [name='password_reset_done']
accounts/reset/<uidb64>/<token>/ [name='password_reset_confirm']
accounts/reset/done/ [name='password_reset_complete']
This tells us at the path accounts/login/ is where “login” is located and its name is
'login'. A little confusing at first, but here is the info we need.
Going a step deeper to phase two, we can investigate the underlying Django source
code to see “logout” in action. If you perform a search over on Github99 you’ll
eventually find the auth app itself100 . Ok, now let’s start by investigating the urls.py
file. Here is the link101 to the complete code:
98 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/auth/default/#module-django.contrib.auth.views
99 https://github.com/django/django

101 https://github.com/django/django/blob/b9cf764be62e77b4777b3a75ec256f6209a57671/django/contrib/auth/
urls.py
Chapter 5: User Registration
Code</p>
<h1 id="djangocontribauthurlspy">django/contrib/auth/urls.py</h1>
<p>from django.contrib.auth import views
from django.urls import path
94
urlpatterns = [
path('login/', views.LoginView.as_view(), name='login'),
path('logout/', views.LogoutView.as_view(), name='logout'),
]
path('password_change/', views.PasswordChangeView.as_view(),
name='password_change'),
path('password_change/done/', views.PasswordChangeDoneView.as_view(),
name='password_change_done'),
path('password_reset/', views.PasswordResetView.as_view(),
name='password_reset'),
path('password_reset/done/', views.PasswordResetDoneView.as_view(),
name='password_reset_done'),
path('reset/<uidb64>/<token>/', views.PasswordResetConfirmView.as_view(),
name='password_reset_confirm'),
path('reset/done/', views.PasswordResetCompleteView.as_view(),
name='password_reset_complete'),
Here is the underlying code Django uses itself for the auth app. I hope you can see
that the “logout” route is not magic. It’s right there in plain sight, it uses the view
LogoutView and has the URL name 'logout'. Not magic at all! Just a little challenging
to find the first time.
This three-step process is a great way to learn: either remember the Django shortcut,
Chapter 5: User Registration
 95
look it up in the docs, or on occasion dive into the source code and truly understand
where all this goodness comes from.
Log In
Back on our basic homepage, click on the “Log In” link and... it results in an error!
Log in template not exist error
Django is throwing a TemplateDoesNotExist error at us. Specifically, it seems to expect
a log in template at registration/login.html. In addition to Django telling us this,
we can look in the documentation102 and see that the desired template_name has that
location.
But let’s really be sure and check the source code so we can remove any perceived
magic here. After all, it’s just Django.
Back in the auth/views.py103 file we can see on line 45 for LoginView that the
template_name is 'registration/login.html'. So if we wanted to change the default
location we could, but it would mean overriding LoginView which seems like overkill.
102 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/auth/default/#all-authentication-views
103 https://github.com/django/django/blob/b9cf764be62e77b4777b3a75ec256f6209a57671/django/contrib/auth/
views.py
Chapter 5: User Registration
 96
Let’s just use what Django gives us here.
Create a new registration folder within the existing templates directory and then
add our login.html file there, too.
Command Line
$ mkdir templates/registration
$ touch templates/registration/login.html
The actual code is as follows. We extend our base template, add a title, and then
specify that we want to use a form that will “post” or send the data.
Code</p>
<!-- templates/registration/login.html -->
<p>{% extends '_base.html' %}
{% block title %}Log In{% endblock title %}
{% block content %}</p>
<h2>Log In</h2>
<form method="post">
{% csrf_token %}
{{ form.as_p }}
<button type="submit">Log In</button>
</form>
<p>{% endblock content %}
You should always add CSRF protection104 on any submittable form. Otherwise a
malicious website can change the link and attack the site and the user. Django has
104 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/csrf/
Chapter 5: User Registration
 97
CSRF middleware to handle this for us; all we need to do is add {% csrf_token %} tags
at the start of the form.
Next we can control the look of the form contents. For now we’ll use as_p()105 so that
each form field is displayed within a paragraph p tag.
With that explanation out of the way, let’s check if our new template is working
correctly. Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/login/106.
Log in page
And there is our page! Lovely. You can navigate back to the homepage and confirm
that the “Log In” link works too if you like. As a final step, go ahead and try log in.
Redirects
Did you notice I said “try” in that last sentence? If you click on the “Log In” link it
brings up a Page not found (404) error.
105 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/forms/api/#as-p
106 http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/login/
Chapter 5: User Registration
 98
Page not found error
It seems Django has redirected us to 127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/profile/ yet no such
page exists. Now why would Django do this? Well, if you think about it, how does
Django know where we want to redirect the user after log in? Maybe it’s the home-
page. But maybe it’s a user profile page. Or any number of options.
The final piece of the log in puzzle is to set the proper configuration for LOGIN_-
REDIRECT_URL107 because by default it redirects to accounts/profile.
Fortunately this is a quick fix. We’ll send the user to our homepage. And since we
specified a URL name of home that’s all we need to redirect logged in users to the
homepage.
At the bottom of the bookstore_project/settings.py file add this one line.
107 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/settings/#login-redirect-url
Chapter 5: User Registration
 99
Code</p>
<h1 id="bookstore_projectsettingspy_1">bookstore_project/settings.py</h1>
<p>LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = 'home'
Refresh the webpage and you will see it notices the change and provides us with the
generic “You are not logged in” greeting.
Homepage logged out
Log Out
Now let’s add a log out option to our homepage since only a superuser will have access
to the admin. How do we do this?
If you look at the auth views above we can see that logout uses LogoutView, which we
could explore in the source code, and has a URL name of logout. That means we can
refer to it with a template tag as just logout.
But we can set this ourself, if desired, using LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL108 which can
be added to the bottom of our bookstore_project/settings.py file. Let’s do that so a
logged out user is redirected to the homepage.

Chapter 5: User Registration
Code</p>
<h1 id="bookstore_projectsettingspy_2">bookstore_project/settings.py</h1>
<p>LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = 'home'
LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL = 'home' # new
Then add the logout link to templates/home.html.
Code</p>
<!-- templates/home.html -->
<p>{% extends '_base.html' %}
100
{% block title %}Home{% endblock title %}
{% block content %}</p>
<h1>Homepage</h1>
<p>{% if user.is_authenticated %}
Hi {{ user.email }}!</p>
<p><a href="{% url 'logout' %}">Log Out</a></p>
<p>{% else %}</p>
<p>You are not logged in</p>
<p><a href="{% url 'login' %}">Log In</a>
{% endif %}
{% endblock content %}
Go back into the admin at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/109 to log in. Then navigate to
the homepage http://127.0.0.1:8000/110 which now has the “Log out” link.

If you click on it you will be logged out and see our homepage with a log in link.
Sign Up
Implementing a sign up page for user registration is completely up to us. We’ll go
through the standard steps for any new page:
• add a URL path in users/urls.py
• update bookstore_project/urls.py to point to the users app
• create a users/views.py file
• create a signup.html template
• update _base.html to display the sign up page
A common question is: what’s the right order for implementing these steps? Honestly
it doesn’t matter since we need all of them for the sign up page to work properly.
Generally I like to start with urls, then switch to views, and finally templates but it’s a
matter of personal preference.
To start create a urls.py file within the users app. Up to this point it only contains our
CustomUser in the models.py file; we haven’t configured any routes or views.
Chapter 5: User Registration
Command Line
$ touch users/urls.py
102
The URL path for the sign up page will take a view called SignupPageView (which we’ll
create next), at the route signup/, and have a name of signup which we can later use to
refer to the page with a url template tag. The existing url names for login and signup
are written within the built-in Django app file django/contrib/auth/urls.py we saw
above.
Code</p>
<h1 id="usersurlspy">users/urls.py</h1>
<p>from django.urls import path
from .views import SignupPageView
urlpatterns = [
path('signup/', SignupPageView.as_view(), name='signup'),
]
Next update the bookstore_project/urls.py file to include the users app. We can
create any route we like but it’s common to use the same accounts/ one used by the
default auth app. Note that it’s important to include the path for users.urls below:
URL paths are loaded top-to-bottom so this ensures that any auth URL paths will be
loaded first.
Chapter 5: User Registration
 103
Code</p>
<h1 id="bookstore_projecturlspy_1">bookstore_project/urls.py</h1>
<p>from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include
urlpatterns = [</p>
<h1 id="django-admin_1">Django admin</h1>
<p>path('admin/', admin.site.urls),</p>
<h1 id="user-management_1">User management</h1>
<p>path('accounts/', include('django.contrib.auth.urls')),</p>
<h1 id="local-apps_1">Local apps</h1>
<p>path('accounts/', include('users.urls')), # new
path('', include('pages.urls')),
]
Now we can create our view which will be called SignupPageView. It references the
CustomUserCreationForm, has a success_url that points to the login page meaning after
the form is submitted the user will be redirected there. And the template_name will be
signup.html.
Chapter 5: User Registration
Code</p>
<h1 id="usersviewspy">users/views.py</h1>
<p>from django.urls import reverse_lazy
from django.views import generic
from .forms import CustomUserCreationForm
104
class SignupPageView(generic.CreateView):
form_class = CustomUserCreationForm
success_url = reverse_lazy('login')
template_name = 'signup.html'
Finally we have our template. Create a signup.html file within our existing templates
directory.
Command Line
$ touch templates/signup.html
The code is basically identical to the log in page.
Chapter 5: User Registration
Code</p>
<!-- templates/signup.html -->
<p>{% extends '_base.html' %}
{% block title %}Sign Up{% endblock title %}
105
{% block content %}</p>
<h2>Sign Up</h2>
<form method="post">
{% csrf_token %}
{{ form.as_p }}
<button type="submit">Sign Up</button>
</form>
<p>{% endblock content %}
As a final step we can add a line for “Sign Up” to our home.html template right below
the link for “Log In”. This is a one-line change.
Code</p>
<!-- templates/home.html -->
<p>{% extends '_base.html' %}
{% block title %}Home{% endblock title %}
{% block content %}</p>
<h1>Homepage</h1>
<p>{% if user.is_authenticated %}
Hi {{ user.email }}!</p>
<p><a href="{% url 'logout' %}">Log Out</a></p>
<p>Chapter 5: User Registration
{% else %}</p>
<p>You are not logged in</p>
<p><a href="{% url 'login' %}">Log In</a>
<a href="{% url 'signup' %}">Sign Up</a>
{% endif %}
{% endblock content %}
All done! Reload the homepage to see our work.
106
Homepage with Signup
The “Sign Up” link will redirect us to http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/signup/111.
Signup page
Create a new user with the email address testuser@email.com, username of testuser,
111 http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/signup/

and testpass123 for the password. Upon submission it will redirect us to the Log In
page. Attempt to log in with this new account.

Tests
For tests we do not need to test log in and log out features since those are built into
Django and already have tests. We do need to test our sign up functionality though!
Let’s start by creating a setUp method that loads our page. Then we’ll populate test_-
signup_template with tests for the status code, template used, and both included and
excluded text similarly to how we did it in the last chapter for the homepage.
In your text editor, update the users/tests.py file with these changes.
Code</p>
<h1 id="userstestspy">users/tests.py</h1>
<p>from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
from django.test import TestCase
from django.urls import reverse # new
class CustomUserTests(TestCase):
...
Chapter 5: User Registration
 108
class SignupPageTests(TestCase): # new
def setUp(self):
url = reverse('signup')
self.response = self.client.get(url)
def test_signup_template(self):
self.assertEqual(self.response.status_code, 200)
self.assertTemplateUsed(self.response, 'signup.html')
self.assertContains(self.response, 'Sign Up')
self.assertNotContains(
self.response, 'Hi there! I should not be on the page.')
Then run our tests.
Command Line
$ docker-compose exec web python manage.py test
Creating test database for alias 'default'...
System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
........</p>
<hr />
<p>Ran 8 tests in 0.329s
OK
Destroying test database for alias 'default'...
Next we can test that our CustomUserCreationForm is being used and that the page
resolves to SignupPageView.
Chapter 5: User Registration
Code</p>
<h1 id="userstestspy_1">users/tests.py</h1>
<p>from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
from django.test import TestCase
from django.urls import reverse, resolve # new
from .forms import CustomUserCreationForm # new
from .views import SignupPageView # new
class CustomUserTests(TestCase):
...
class SignupPageTests(TestCase):
def setUp(self):
url = reverse('signup')
self.response = self.client.get(url)
def test_signup_template(self):
self.assertEqual(self.response.status_code, 200)
self.assertTemplateUsed(self.response, 'signup.html')
self.assertContains(self.response, 'Sign Up')
self.assertNotContains(
self.response, 'Hi there! I should not be on the page.')
def test_signup_form(self): # new
form = self.response.context.get('form')
self.assertIsInstance(form, CustomUserCreationForm)
109
Chapter 5: User Registration
self.assertContains(self.response,'csrfmiddlewaretoken')
110
def test_signup_view(self): # new
view = resolve('/accounts/signup/')
self.assertEqual(
view.func.<strong>name</strong>,
SignupPageView.as_view().<strong>name</strong>
)
Run our tests again.
Command Line
$ docker-compose exec web python manage.py test
Creating test database for alias 'default'...
System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
..........</p>
<hr />
<p>Ran 10 tests in 0.328s
OK
Destroying test database for alias 'default'...
All done.
setUpTestData()
Django 1.8 introduced a major update to TestCase112 that added the ability to run tests
both within a whole class and for each individual test. In particular, setUpTestData()113
112 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/releases/1.8/#testcase-data-setup
113 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/testing/tools/#django.test.TestCase.setUpTestData
Chapter 5: User Registration
 111
allows the creation of initial data at the class level that can be applied to the entire
TestCase. This results in much faster tests than using setUp(), however, care must be
taken not to modify any objects created in setUpTestData() in your test methods.
We will use setUp() in this book, but be aware that if your test suite seems sluggish,
setUpTestData() is a potential optimization to look into.
Git
As ever make sure to save our work by adding changes into Git.
Command Line
$ git status
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'ch5'
The official source code is located on Github114 if you want to compare your code.
Conclusion
Our Bookstore project is not the most beautiful site in the world, but it is very
functional at this point. In the next chapter we’ll configure our static assets and add
Bootstrap for improved styling.
